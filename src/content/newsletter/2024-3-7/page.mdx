## Starting fresh with episode 1 

Why Episode 1? I've decided to invest more time and effort into my newsletter. All future episodes will now be 
available on my newsletter archive at [https://zackproser.com/newsletter](https://zackproser.com/newsletter).

Going forward, each of my newsletter episodes will include: 

* My work - posts, videos, open-source projects I've recently shipped
* What's abuzz in the news - new AI models, open-source models, LLMs, GPTs, custom GPTs and more
* My favorite tools - a good snapshot of the AI-enhanced and other developer tooling I'm enamored with at the moment 


I will aim to publish and send a new episode every two weeks. 

## My work

### 2023 Wins - My year in review 

[2023 was a big year for me](/blog/2023-wins), including a career pivot to a new role, a new company and my first formal entry into the AI space. 

I reflect on my wins and learnings from the previous year. 

### Testing Pinecone Serverless at Scale with the AWS Reference Architecture 

[I updated the Pinecone AWS Reference Architecture to use Pinecone Serverless](/blog/pinecone-reference-architecture-scaling), making for an excellent test bed for 
putting Pinecone through its paces at scale. 

Just keep an eye on your AWS bill!

### Codeium vs ChatGPT

I get asked often enough about the differences between Codeium for code completion (intelligent autocomplete) and ChatGPT4, that I figured I should just write a 
[comprehensive comparison](/blog/codeium-vs-chatgpt) of their capabilities and utility. 

### My first book credit - My Horrible Career

What started out as an extended conversation with my programming mentor John Arundel became [a whole book!](/blog/my-horrible-career)

### How to build a sitemap for Next.js that captures static and dynamic routes

Some [old-school tutorial content](/blog/how-to-next-js-sitemap) for my Next.js and Vercel fans.

## What's abuzz in the news

### Anthropic releases Claude 3 family of models

I've been experimenting with Claude 3 Opus, their most intelligent model, to see how it slots in for high-level architecture discussions and code generation compared to ChatGPT 4. 

So far, so good, but I'll have more thoughts and observations here soon. Watch this space!

## My favorite tools

### High-level code completion 

Currently neck and neck between ChatGPT 4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus. Stay tuned for more thoughts.
