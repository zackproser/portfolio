<figcaption>Most people speak at 150+ WPM but type at only 40-60 WPM</figcaption>

You speak at 150-180 words per minute. You type at 40-60 WPM. That's a 3x gap you're leaving on the table.

Here's how to actually dictate faster than typing—with techniques that work.

## The Math

| Method | Speed | 1,000 Words Takes |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Typing (average) | 40 WPM | 25 minutes |
| Typing (fast) | 60 WPM | 17 minutes |
| Dictation | 150-180 WPM | 6-7 minutes |

Even accounting for corrections, dictation wins by 2-3x for most people.

## The Tool

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is the dictation tool I use. It works everywhere on Mac, cleans up your speech with AI, and actually hits 170+ WPM in practice.

## Technique 1: Think in Complete Thoughts

**Wrong approach**: Start talking, pause, um, think, continue, backtrack...

**Right approach**: Form the complete thought, then speak it.

Before you press the dictation key:
1. Know your next sentence
2. Take a breath
3. Speak it clearly
4. Repeat

This feels slower at first but eliminates the "um" cleanup and re-recording.

## Technique 2: Outline First, Dictate Second

For anything longer than a quick email:

1. **Jot down 3-5 bullet points** (or dictate them)
2. **Dictate each section** from memory
3. **Edit on screen** after dictating

Separating thinking from speaking from editing is faster than doing all three simultaneously.

## Technique 3: Use Your Walking Time

Dictation works anywhere you can speak:
- Walking to meetings
- Commuting (not while driving actively)
- Exercising
- Waiting in lines

I dictate first drafts while walking. The movement actually helps ideas flow.

## Technique 4: Embrace Imperfection

Your first dictated draft won't be perfect. Neither is your first typed draft.

The goal isn't perfect speech—it's getting ideas out of your head 3x faster. Edit later.

**Bad habit**: Re-recording sentences until they're "right"
**Good habit**: Keep going, fix it in editing

## Technique 5: Learn Your Tool's Strengths

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> specifically:
- Removes "um" and "uh" automatically
- Fixes grammar without you asking
- Learns your vocabulary over time
- Works in any app

This means you can speak more naturally than with traditional dictation. The AI handles the cleanup.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Dictating in Noisy Environments
Find a quiet spot for important dictation. Background noise increases errors and cognitive load.

### 2. Mumbling
Speak clearly and at normal volume. You don't need to shout, but don't whisper either.

### 3. Rushing
Slightly slower, clearer speech is faster than quick, garbled speech that needs re-recording.

### 4. Not Editing
Dictation produces a draft, not a final product. Budget time for a quick edit pass.

## Speed Progression

**Week 1**: Awkward, lots of restarts, maybe 1.5x typing speed
**Week 2**: More comfortable, fewer restarts, 2x typing speed
**Week 4**: Natural flow, minimal editing needed, 2.5-3x typing speed

The learning curve is about a week. After that, you won't want to go back.

## Best Use Cases

Dictation works best for:
- **Emails and messages**: Quick responses
- **First drafts**: Get ideas down fast
- **Meeting follow-ups**: While details are fresh
- **Documentation**: Long-form content

Dictation works less well for:
- **Code**: Syntax is awkward to speak
- **Highly formatted documents**: Tables, complex layouts
- **Environments where you can't speak**: Libraries, open offices

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>Try WisprFlow free</AffiliateLink> and practice with these exercises:

1. **Day 1**: Dictate 5 emails
2. **Day 2**: Dictate a 500-word document
3. **Day 3**: Dictate while walking
4. **Day 4**: Dictate meeting notes
5. **Day 5**: Dictate everything you'd normally type

By day 5, you'll have the rhythm.

## FAQ

### What about punctuation?

Modern AI dictation (like WisprFlow) figures out punctuation from context. You don't need to say "period" or "comma."

### Is dictation weird in an office?

Many people dictate in meeting rooms, while walking, or with headphones on. It's becoming normal.

### What if I have an accent?

WisprFlow handles diverse accents well. Accuracy improves as it learns your voice.
