## Now anyone can ask for software 

Ask for a minimal CRUD API or a shiny Next.js signup flow and an LLM will hand you something that runs in seconds. 

What used to cost junior devs a weekend of Googling is now commodity scaffolding.

But the folks that are still getting the most lift from these tools are seasoned engineers. Why?

## Producing ≠ understanding

LLMs compress the surface patterns of expert work, but they don’t transfer the scar‑tissue knowledge that tells you when to violate an abstraction, why that race condition only appears under load, or how to triage a silent data‑loss bug. Those instincts are earned—usually the hard way—through busted deploys and 3 AM pages.

## The rise of “burn‑free builders”

Developers who’ve never “burned their hand” can now merge PRs that compile yet hide landmines:
-	secrets leaked because the scaffold skipped .env.example
-	an O(N²) routine buried in a generically‑typed helper
-	a licensing mismatch hallucinated into package.json

LLMs flatten the cost of output creation, not the cost of production failure.

## A shorter, more inclusive learning loop 

LLMs don’t just scaffold apps for seniors—they can close the “unknown‑unknowns” gap for newcomers.

When I started teaching myself development {RenderNumYearsExperience()} years ago, I didn't know the name 
of the things I didn't know, so it was harder to Google them or search StackOverflow.

Today, you could spend a few minutes describing what you're talking about to an LLM and unstick yourself: 

> I’m seeing “CORS” errors in the console but don’t know the term—explain what it is and how to fix it in a local Next.js dev setup.

The model surfaces the concept, provides the vocabulary, and shows the fix you couldn’t search for.

**Key trade‑off**: LLMs accelerate explanation but learning still requires deliberate practice. 

Copy‑pasting answers without running the code, writing tests, or confronting failures leaves your mental model half‑baked.

Bottom line: experienced devs leverage LLMs to move faster, but beginners can now reach competence orders of magnitude quicker—if they treat the model as an interactive tutor, not an answer vending machine.

## A resource for new builders

If you’re new‑ish to coding (or just new to AI‑assisted coding) and want guard‑rails that prevent the classic secret‑leak + deployment‑meltdown combo, I just shipped [Vibe‑Coding Mastery](/products/vibe-coding-mastery), a premium tutorial that:
-	walks through git essentials so you can save your code and void leaking secrets, using clear visuals and screencasts, not jargon
-	provides Cursor rules that tailor the LLM to your experience level and help you learn more quickly as you work 
-	includes screencasts and the commands - get exactly what you need to succeed, and watch me do it whenever you get stuck 

It’s tailored for builders who don’t have a decade of war stories but still want to ship confidently. (Details are on [the guide’s page](/products/vibe-coding-mastery).)

## Final thoughts
1.	Treat LLM output as a first draft, not an artifact.
2.	Instrument the feedback loop. Follow every scaffolding prompt with a “why did you choose X over Y?” interrogation.
3.	Cache your burns. Feed past post‑mortems back into your prompting so the model stops recreating yesterday’s outage.
4.	Invest in meta‑skills. Debugging, system design, and ethics aren’t commoditized by autocomplete.
