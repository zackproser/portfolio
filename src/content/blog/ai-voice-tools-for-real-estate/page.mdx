<figcaption>Voice AI tools help real estate agents capture client needs and create listings faster</figcaption>

Real estate agents live on their phones. Between showings, client calls, and property visits, there's barely time to sit at a desk—let alone type out detailed notes and listing descriptions.

Voice AI tools solve this problem. Speak your notes after a showing, dictate listing descriptions while walking the property, and never miss what a client said they wanted.

## The Tools

## WisprFlow for Listing Descriptions and Client Communication

</a>

[WisprFlow](https://ref.wisprflow.ai/zack-proser) is voice-to-text that works everywhere on your Mac. Speak naturally, and polished text appears in your MLS, CRM, email—anywhere you're typing.

### Real Estate Use Cases

**Listing descriptions**: Walk through a property and describe it out loud. WisprFlow captures your observations and formats them professionally. A 300-word listing description takes 90 seconds instead of 15 minutes.

**Client follow-ups**: After a showing, dictate your follow-up email while driving to the next appointment. "Thanks for meeting me at 123 Oak Street today. Based on what you mentioned about needing a home office and wanting to stay under 500k, I have two more properties I think you'll love..."

**Showing notes**: Dictate what clients liked and didn't like immediately after each showing. Never forget critical feedback.

**Offer letters**: Speak through the terms and let WisprFlow format them properly.

### Speed Comparison

Most people type 40-50 WPM.
WisprFlow enables 150-180 WPM dictation.
**That's 3-4x faster documentation.**

## Granola for Client Meetings and Phone Calls

<a href="https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

</a>

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) captures your conversations and creates organized notes with action items—without anyone knowing it's running.

### Perfect for Real Estate

**Client consultations**: First meetings with buyers or sellers involve tons of information. Granola captures everything: budget, timeline, must-haves, deal-breakers. Review the transcript later to ensure you didn't miss anything.

**Phone calls**: The iOS app captures phone conversations. When a client calls to discuss an offer, you have a complete record of what was discussed.

**Property walk-throughs**: Use the mobile app during property visits to capture your observations hands-free.

**No awkward recording announcements**: Other tools join calls as a visible bot. Granola runs invisibly—clients won't feel like they're being recorded.

| Listing descriptions | 3 hrs | 1 hr | 2 hrs |
| Client follow-ups | 4 hrs | 1.5 hrs | 2.5 hrs |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do these work on iPhone?

Granola has an iOS app for phone calls and in-person meetings. WisprFlow is currently Mac-only, but you can use it when back at your computer or laptop.

### Will clients know I'm recording?

Not with Granola—there's no bot that joins calls. For phone recordings, check your state's consent laws, but Granola operates invisibly.

### Can I dictate into my MLS system?

Yes. WisprFlow works with any application where you can type. If you can click in a field and type, you can dictate.

### What about transaction management software?

Same answer—WisprFlow works at the system level. Dotloop, SkySlope, whatever you use.

### Is this worth the subscription cost?

If you save even 2 hours per week (conservative estimate), that's time you can spend on showings or client development. The ROI is immediate.

*Your time is better spent with clients than at a keyboard. These tools let you stay in the field while still documenting everything.*
