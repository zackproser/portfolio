<figcaption>Voice AI tools help sales reps capture every deal detail and follow up faster</figcaption>

Sales is a game of details. The rep who remembers what the prospect said on the first call closes more deals than the one scrambling to recall key points.

Voice AI tools capture every conversation and speed up follow-ups—giving you an edge in competitive deals.

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures your calls and creates structured notes with action items—without prospects knowing you're recording.

### Why Sales Reps Need This

**Never miss a buying signal**: Prospects mention budget, timeline, and decision-makers in passing. Granola catches everything.

**No distracting bot**: Other tools join calls visibly. Prospects notice and sometimes get guarded. Granola runs invisibly.

**Automatic follow-up list**: Every call ends with clear next steps extracted automatically.

### Sales Use Cases

- **Discovery calls**: Capture pain points, current solutions, and decision criteria
- **Demo calls**: Note specific features that resonated and objections raised
- **Negotiation**: Exact record of what was offered and discussed
- **Internal handoffs**: Pass complete context to AEs, SEs, or customer success

### The "I'll Send a Recap" Advantage

Send detailed follow-ups within minutes of hanging up. While your competitor is still typing notes, you've already reinforced every key point.

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is voice-to-text that works in Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach—anywhere you update deals.

### CRM Updates in Seconds

**Speak your notes**: After each call, dictate directly into the opportunity record. "Spoke with CFO, budget confirmed at $50K, need security review before..."

**Email follow-ups**: Dictate personalized follow-ups at 170 WPM instead of typing at 50 WPM. Send while the call is still fresh.

**Proposals and quotes**: Speak through custom sections instead of typing.

### The Admin Time Problem

Studies show sales reps spend only 34% of their time actually selling. The rest is admin work. Voice tools attack that directly.
