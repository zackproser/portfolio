## Why WisprFlow Wins

### 1. It Actually Works Everywhere

Click in any app—Chrome, Slack, VS Code, Word, anything—press the hotkey, and speak. Text appears. macOS dictation fails constantly in non-Apple apps.

### 2. AI Makes Your Speech Sound Written

When I say "So um basically what I'm thinking is that uh we should probably consider um the alternative approach", WisprFlow outputs: "We should consider the alternative approach."

That's not transcription. That's transformation.

### 3. Speed That Matters

I speak at about 170 WPM with WisprFlow. That's 3x my typing speed. Over a day of writing, that adds up to hours saved.

### 4. It Learns Your Vocabulary

Technical terms, names, jargon—WisprFlow learns what you use. After a week, it recognizes your specific vocabulary.

## FAQ

### Is the built-in Mac dictation good enough?

For occasional use in Apple apps, maybe. For serious work, no. It doesn't clean up speech, fails in many apps, and feels dated.

### What about Dragon?

Dragon was great in 2010. The Mac version was discontinued. The cloud version exists but isn't competitive with modern AI tools.

### Does WisprFlow work offline?

It requires internet for the AI processing that makes it work so well. The tradeoff is worth it.

### Can I use this for coding?

Yes, though voice is better for prose than code. I use WisprFlow for comments, documentation, and commit messages. See my [developer setup guide](/blog/best-voice-to-text-for-developers).
