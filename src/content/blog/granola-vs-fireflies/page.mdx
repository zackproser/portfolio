Choosing between Granola and Fireflies.ai for meeting notes? Both use AI to capture and summarize your meetings, but they work very differently.

**Quick answer:** [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser?utm_source=zackproser&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=granola-vs-fireflies&utm_content=text-link) wins for most professionals because it captures meetings without a visible bot joining your call. Fireflies is better for teams that need centralized meeting databases and CRM integrations.

## The fundamental difference

**Granola** captures audio directly from your device's microphone. No bot joins. Participants see only you on the call.

**Fireflies.ai** sends a bot named "Fireflies.ai Notetaker" that joins your meeting as a visible participant. Everyone sees it.

This matters more than any other feature.

## Why the bot matters

When a recording bot joins:

- Participants notice and ask about it
- The conversation becomes more guarded
- Some meeting hosts block bots entirely
- It feels like surveillance

I've been in client calls where the first five minutes were derailed by "Is that recording us?" discussions. With Granola, that never happens.

## Feature comparison

| Feature | Granola | Fireflies.ai |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Visible bot** | No | Yes |
| **Works everywhere** | Yes (any audio) | Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex |
| **In-person meetings** | Yes (mobile app) | No |
| **CRM integration** | Limited | Extensive |
| **Team collaboration** | Basic | Advanced |
| **Search across meetings** | Yes | Yes |
| **Custom templates** | Yes | Yes |
| **API access** | No | Yes |

## Pricing comparison

**Granola**
- Free tier: 25 meetings/month
- Pro: $12/month (unlimited meetings)
- Business: $18/user/month

**Fireflies.ai**
- Free tier: Limited transcription minutes
- Pro: $10/month (unlimited)
- Business: $19/month
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

Fireflies looks cheaper, but the free tier is heavily limited and the bot problem remains at every price point.

## When to use Granola

Choose Granola if you:

- Have client-facing calls where recording bots feel awkward
- Want to capture in-person meetings and hallway conversations
- Prefer privacy over team collaboration features
- Need to record on any platform including phone calls
- Want participants to feel comfortable speaking freely

## When to use Fireflies.ai

Choose Fireflies if you:

- Need CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Want a centralized meeting database for the whole team
- Only have internal meetings where bot visibility doesn't matter
- Need API access for custom workflows
- Require meeting analytics across your organization

## Real-world experience

I've used both extensively. The technical quality of transcription is similar — both use state-of-the-art speech recognition and make occasional errors.

The difference is entirely in how they capture audio.

With Fireflies, I had a sales prospect literally say "I'm going to be more careful what I say now" when the bot joined. That's not paranoia — that's a natural human response to visible recording.

With Granola, I've had hundreds of meetings where the conversation flowed naturally because nobody knew I was capturing notes.

## Migration path

If you're currently on Fireflies and want to switch:

1. Export your existing transcripts (Fireflies allows this)
2. Cancel your subscription
3. Install Granola and connect your calendar
4. Your next meeting starts the new workflow

The transition is seamless because both tools work independently of your calendar and meeting apps.

## My recommendation

For most professionals, **Granola is the better choice**. The "no bot" approach solves a real problem that Fireflies can't address at any price point.

The exception is large teams that need centralized meeting intelligence with CRM integrations. Fireflies has genuinely better team features — if you can accept the bot.
