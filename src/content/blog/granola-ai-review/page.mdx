<figcaption>Granola transforms how you capture and organize meeting notes with AI-powered transcription</figcaption>

I've been using [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) daily for months now, across every work meeting, personal call, and impromptu conversation worth capturing. After putting it through its paces, I can confidently say it's transformed how I handle meetings—and completely eliminated my note-taking anxiety.

## What Is Granola?

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) is an AI-powered notepad that transcribes your meetings and enhances your notes without requiring a bot to join your calls. Unlike tools like Fireflies or Otter that announce themselves by joining as a participant, Granola captures audio directly from your device and works silently in the background.

The key differentiator is the collaborative approach: you can take your own notes during the meeting, and Granola enhances them with context from the transcript. Or you can ignore it entirely and let it handle everything. Either way, you walk away with comprehensive, well-organized notes.

## Getting Started with Granola

One of the things I love about [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) is how effortless the setup is. Here's how to get it running in under 5 minutes:

### Installation & Setup

1. **Download the app** from [granola.ai](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) for macOS, Windows, or iOS
2. **Sign in with Google** — Granola uses Google single sign-on, so you'll need a Google Workspace or personal Gmail account
3. **Grant permissions** — Allow microphone and system audio access so Granola can transcribe your meetings
4. **Connect your calendar** — Your Google Calendar syncs automatically, showing upcoming meetings in the app

That's it. You're ready to go.

### Automatic Meeting Detection

Here's where the magic happens. Once you've synced your calendar, [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) will:

- **Send a notification one minute before scheduled meetings** with 2+ attendees
- **Open both your video call AND start transcribing** with a single click on the notification
- **Detect ad-hoc calls automatically** — even if a meeting isn't on your calendar, Granola notices when your microphone is in use and offers to start taking notes

This "set it and forget it" approach means you never have to remember to start Granola. It's just there, ready to capture everything important.

<figcaption>Granola's mobile app means you can capture conversations anywhere—even on a walk</figcaption>

## My Daily Workflow

I now use [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) for literally everything—work calls, personal conversations, impromptu discussions. Here's how it fits into my life:

### Work Meetings

Every Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams call gets captured automatically. I've set up folders to organize discussions by project, client, and meeting type. This organizational structure means I can quickly pull up notes from any previous conversation when I need context for follow-ups.

### Personal Calls

Phone calls with family, friends, and anyone else I want to remember clearly now get the Granola treatment. Important details don't slip through the cracks anymore.

### On-the-Go Conversations

This is where [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) really shines. The iOS app lets me capture coffee meetings, conference hallway conversations, and impromptu brainstorms with a single tap from the lock screen. Walking between sessions at a conference? One tap and you're capturing everything worth remembering.

<figcaption>Before Granola, my mind was cluttered with trying to remember everything from meetings</figcaption>

## The End of Note-Taking Anxiety

Here's the transformation I didn't expect: my actual presence in meetings has improved dramatically.

Before [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser), I was always half-focused on capturing the right information. Should I write that down? Did I miss something important while typing? What if they mention a number I need later?

Now I just talk. I engage fully with whoever I'm speaking with, knowing Granola is capturing everything. If a key decision gets made, I know I can verify the exact wording later. If someone commits to a deadline or deliverable, it's recorded.

This isn't just convenience—it's a fundamental shift in how I experience conversations. I'm more present, more engaged, and ironically, I remember more because I'm actually paying attention instead of frantically scribbling.

## Templates for Standardized Outputs

One feature that's proven invaluable for team workflows is [Granola's](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) template system. I've created templates for:

- **Customer discovery calls**: Automatically extracts pain points, feature requests, and follow-up actions

- **1:1 meetings**: Captures discussion topics, decisions made, and commitments from both parties  

- **Team standups**: Pulls out blockers, progress updates, and cross-functional dependencies

- **Sales calls**: Organizes prospect information, objections raised, and next steps

When a meeting ends, I select the appropriate template and Granola formats the notes accordingly. This means my team gets consistent artifacts from every call without me having to manually restructure notes after each meeting.

## Cross-Platform Availability

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) works across macOS, Windows, and iOS, which covers my entire device ecosystem:

- **Desktop (Mac/Windows)**: Perfect for scheduled video calls and screen-sharing sessions

- **iPhone**: Ideal for phone calls, in-person meetings, and impromptu conversations

The sync is seamless—notes taken on my phone appear on desktop immediately, and vice versa. I frequently start a conversation on mobile during a walk and review the enhanced notes on my Mac later.

The iOS app is particularly well-designed for quick capture. You can start recording from a lock screen widget with a single tap, which is crucial when you need to capture something unexpected without fumbling through apps.

<figcaption>At the end of my walks, I have clarity on decisions and all the details captured</figcaption>

## What Makes It Different

Unlike traditional meeting bots, [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) doesn't announce itself or make your meetings feel surveilled. There's no "Granola Bot has joined the meeting" moment that makes everyone self-conscious.

The hybrid approach—your notes enhanced by AI transcription—produces better results than either pure AI summarization or manual note-taking alone. The AI adds context and completeness; your notes provide emphasis and priority.

And the chat feature lets you query your notes later. Need to find what was said about a specific topic across multiple meetings? Just ask.

## Part of My Voice-First Stack

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) has become an essential part of my broader [voice-first productivity stack](/blog/best-ai-voice-tools-2025). While [WisprFlow](/blog/wisprflow-review) handles my voice-to-text needs for writing and coding, Granola captures everything spoken in meetings.

Together, they've fundamentally changed how I work. I spend more time thinking and speaking than typing, which feels more natural and productive. The combination means I'm never worried about losing important information—whether I'm dictating code, writing a blog post, or sitting in a crucial client meeting.

## Privacy and Security

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) takes privacy and security seriously, with enterprise-grade encryption and comprehensive data protection measures. The fact that no bot joins your calls means your meetings feel more natural, and participants aren't put on notice that they're being recorded by a third party. For detailed information about their security practices, data handling, and compliance, visit their [dedicated trust center](https://trust.granola.ai/).

## Who Should Use Granola

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) is particularly valuable if you:

- Spend significant time in back-to-back meetings

- Need to produce consistent meeting artifacts for your team

- Want to be more present in conversations instead of frantically typing

- Have conversations across multiple platforms (Zoom, phone, in-person)

- Work with sensitive content where you'd rather not have a third-party bot joining calls

## The Bottom Line

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) has become one of those tools I can't imagine working without. The combination of reliable transcription, thoughtful organization features, and cross-platform availability means I'm never worried about losing important information from a conversation.

The note-taking anxiety is gone. I just show up, engage fully, and trust that everything important will be there when I need it.

If you're drowning in meetings and struggling to keep track of what was said, decided, or committed to—give [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) a serious look. It's one of the highest-ROI productivity tools I've adopted this year.
