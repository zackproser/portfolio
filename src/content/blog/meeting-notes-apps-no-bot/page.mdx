You're in a sales call. A bot named "Otter.ai Notetaker" joins. Your prospect asks, "Is that recording us?"

The next five minutes are awkward explanations instead of selling.

There's a better way. These meeting notes apps capture everything **without joining your call**.

## Why bots ruin meetings

Recording bots create problems:

- **Participants clam up** — People speak differently when they know they're recorded
- **Host questions** — "What is that? Should I allow it?"
- **Corporate blocks** — Many companies auto-reject unknown participants
- **Trust erosion** — It feels like surveillance, not note-taking

The best meeting notes are invisible. Here are the apps that get this right.

## 1. Granola (Best Overall)

**How it works:** Captures audio directly from your Mac's microphone. Works with any meeting platform, phone calls and in-person conversations.

**Why it's the best:**
- Zero footprint — nothing joins your call
- Works everywhere (Zoom, Meet, Teams, phone, in-person)
- AI summaries with custom templates
- Mobile app for in-person meetings
- Free tier: 25 meetings/month
- Pro: $12/month unlimited

**The catch:** Mac only (Windows coming). Requires your device to hear the audio.

I've used Granola for hundreds of client calls. Nobody has ever known I was capturing notes.

## 2. Tactiq

**How it works:** Browser extension that reads captions from Google Meet, Zoom and MS Teams in real-time.

**Why it's good:**
- Reads existing captions, no audio capture needed
- Works in Chrome/Edge
- Real-time transcription visible to you only
- Free tier available

**The catch:** Depends on the platform's live captions being enabled. Less accurate than audio-based capture.

## 3. Fathom (Partial)

**How it works:** Can run in "listen-only" mode on some platforms, though it defaults to joining as a bot.

**Why it's good:**
- Excellent AI summaries
- CRM integrations
- Team features

**The catch:** The no-bot mode is limited and not available on all platforms. Most users end up with the bot anyway.

## 4. Otter.ai (Not Recommended)

**Why it's here:** To explain why it doesn't make the list. Otter requires a bot to join your meeting. There's no invisible mode. If you're searching for "meeting notes without bot," Otter isn't it.

## Quick comparison

| App | No Bot | All Platforms | In-Person | Free Tier | Price |
|-----|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Granola** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 25/mo | $12/mo |
| **Tactiq** | ✅ | Limited | ❌ | Yes | $8/mo |
| **Fathom** | Partial | Limited | ❌ | Yes | $15/mo |
| **Otter** | ❌ | Limited | ❌ | Yes | $8/mo |

## My recommendation

For most professionals, [**Granola**](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser?utm_source=zackproser&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=meeting-notes-no-bot&utm_content=recommendation) is the clear choice. It's the only option that:

1. Works with zero meeting footprint
2. Captures any audio source (not just specific platforms)
3. Handles in-person meetings via mobile
4. Produces genuinely useful AI summaries

The $12/month is worth it for the first meeting where you don't have to explain why a robot joined.

## FAQ

<FAQSection
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is it legal to record meetings without telling people?",
      answer: "Laws vary by jurisdiction. Many places require one-party consent (you knowing is enough). Some require all-party consent. Know your local laws. Using invisible recording doesn't change your legal obligations to inform participants if required."
    },
    {
      question: "Can participants tell if Granola is recording?",
      answer: "No. Granola captures audio from your device's microphone. Nothing joins the call, no indicator appears to other participants. It's indistinguishable from you simply being on the call."
    },
    {
      question: "What about in-person meetings?",
      answer: "Granola has a mobile app that captures in-person conversations. Place your phone on the table and it records like a voice memo but with AI transcription and summaries."
    },
    {
      question: "Do these work if I'm not the meeting host?",
      answer: "Yes. All of these capture audio from your end, regardless of who scheduled the meeting. You don't need host permissions."
    }

*The best meeting notes are the ones nobody knows about. Focus on the conversation, not the recording.*
