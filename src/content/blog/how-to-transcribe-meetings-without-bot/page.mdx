<figcaption>Meeting transcription without the awkward "Bot joined the call" notification</figcaption>

You want meeting transcription, but you don't want a bot joining your call announcing "Recording has started" while your client looks uncomfortable.

There's a better way.

## Quick Answer

**<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink>** transcribes meetings without joining your call. It captures audio from your device's microphone, so other participants never know it's running.

## Why Meeting Bots Are Awkward

When you use Otter.ai, Fireflies, or similar tools, this happens:

1. You start a Zoom/Teams/Meet call
2. "Otter.ai Bot has joined the meeting"
3. Your client/prospect/colleague sees a notification
4. "Oh, are you recording this?" (awkward pause)
5. The conversation becomes slightly guarded

Even with consent, visible bots change the dynamic. People speak differently when they see "Recording."

## How Granola Works Differently

Granola captures audio from your computer's microphone—the same audio you hear. It doesn't join your call as a participant.

**What others see:** Just you on the call
**What you get:** Full transcript and organized notes

### The Process

1. You join your meeting normally
2. Granola detects the meeting (syncs with your calendar)
3. It captures audio from your device
4. After the meeting: transcript, summary, and action items

No bot. No notification. No awkwardness.

## Comparing Approaches

| Feature | Bot-Based (Otter, Fireflies) | Device Capture (Granola) |
|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Visible to others | Yes | No |
| Joins as participant | Yes | No |
| Changes meeting dynamic | Yes | No |
| Works on any platform | Usually | Yes |
| Works for in-person | No | Yes (mobile app) |

## Use Cases Where This Matters

### Client Calls
Clients speak more freely when they don't see a recording bot. Capture discovery calls, strategy sessions, and sensitive discussions.

### Interviews
Job candidates or research subjects may be more candid without visible recording. (Always follow consent laws.)

### Internal Meetings
Sometimes the "official record" changes what people say. Capture honest discussions for your own reference.

### Sales Calls
Prospects notice bots. They may wonder what you're doing with the recording. Granola keeps the focus on the conversation.

## Beyond Video Calls

Granola also works for:

- **Phone calls** (iOS app)
- **In-person meetings** (mobile app captures from device mic)
- **Any audio** your device can hear

This makes it more versatile than bot-based tools that only work with specific meeting platforms.

## What About Consent?

You're still responsible for recording consent laws in your jurisdiction. Granola's invisible operation doesn't change the legal requirements—just the user experience.

**One-party consent states**: You can generally record calls you're part of
**Two-party consent states**: All parties must consent

Know your local laws.

## FAQ

### Is this the same as secretly recording people?

You're responsible for consent. Granola is a tool—how you use it is up to you. Many users inform participants they're taking notes without specifying the tool.

### Does it work with Zoom, Teams, and Meet?

Yes. Granola captures whatever audio comes through your device, regardless of platform.

### What about audio quality?

Granola uses the audio you hear. If you can understand the meeting, Granola can transcribe it.

### How is this different from just recording on my phone?

Granola provides AI-powered transcription, summaries, and action items—not just raw audio. It's an intelligent meeting assistant, not a voice memo.

### Can I use this for webinars or presentations I'm attending?

Yes. Any audio your computer plays can be captured for your personal notes.

*The best meeting notes are the ones you don't have to take manually. Granola captures everything without changing how others behave.*
