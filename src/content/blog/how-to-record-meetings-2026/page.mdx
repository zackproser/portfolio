<figcaption>Modern AI tools can record and transcribe meetings without a visible bot joining your call</figcaption>

Meeting recordings have come a long way since screen recording and basic transcription. In 2026, AI-powered tools can capture, transcribe, and summarize your meetings—some without anyone knowing you're recording.

This guide covers the best options for recording Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, and in-person meetings.

## Quick Comparison: Meeting Recording Options in 2026

| Method | Bot Joins? | Works In-Person? | AI Summaries? | Cost |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) | No | Yes | Yes | Free tier / Paid |
| Otter.ai | Yes | Limited | Yes | Paid |
| Zoom Built-in | N/A | No | Basic | With Zoom Pro |
| Teams Built-in | N/A | No | Yes | With Teams |
| Fireflies | Yes | No | Yes | Paid |

## My Recommendation: Granola (No Bot Required)

After testing all the major options, [Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) is my preferred choice because it captures meetings without a bot joining your call.

### Why "No Bot" Matters

When Otter, Fireflies, or similar tools record your meeting, a bot joins the call:

> "Otter.ai has joined the meeting"

This announcement creates problems:

1. **People get self-conscious** - They speak differently when they know they're being recorded by a third-party service
2. **It can feel invasive** - Clients and external partners may not appreciate surprise recording announcements
3. **It disrupts the start of meetings** - "Is everyone okay with the recording?" becomes a required conversation

Granola captures audio directly from your computer's audio output. No bot joins. No one knows it's running.

### How Granola Works

1. **Install the app** (Mac, Windows, or iOS)
2. **Connect your calendar** - It automatically knows when you have meetings
3. **Join your meeting normally** - Granola detects when you're in a call
4. **Review AI notes after** - Transcription, summary, and action items ready

That's it. No configuration per meeting. No remembering to start recording.

### What You Get After Each Meeting

- **Full transcript** - Searchable text of everything said
- **AI summary** - Key points distilled into a few paragraphs
- **Action items** - Who needs to do what, automatically extracted
- **Templates** - Format output consistently (e.g., "Sales Call Template", "Team Standup")

## Recording In-Person Meetings

This is where Granola really stands out. The iOS app lets you record meetings that happen face-to-face:

- Coffee meetings
- Conference conversations
- Client site visits
- Whiteboard sessions

One tap from your phone starts recording. The same AI processing creates transcripts and summaries.

## Recording Zoom Meetings

### Option 1: Granola (Recommended)

1. Have Granola running
2. Join your Zoom meeting normally
3. Granola captures audio automatically
4. Notes appear after the meeting ends

### Option 2: Zoom's Built-in Recording

1. Click "Record" in Zoom
2. Choose cloud or local recording
3. Generates basic transcript
4. Limited AI features

Zoom's built-in recording works but produces less useful output. You get a video file and raw transcript, not structured notes with action items.

## Recording Google Meet

Google Meet's recording feature requires Google Workspace. Even then, it doesn't offer the AI processing that dedicated tools provide.

**Better approach**: Run Granola, which captures Google Meet automatically without any special configuration.

## Recording Microsoft Teams

Teams has good built-in transcription for paid tiers, but:

- It announces recording to all participants
- Transcripts are stored in Microsoft's ecosystem
- AI summaries require additional licenses

Granola offers a simpler, invisible alternative that works across all platforms.

## Privacy and Consent

### Know Your Laws

Recording laws vary by location:

- **One-party consent states/countries**: You can record any conversation you're part of
- **Two-party consent jurisdictions**: All parties must consent to recording

Granola's invisible operation doesn't change your legal obligations. Check your jurisdiction before recording.

### Professional Contexts

For business meetings, consider:

- Company policy on recording
- Client expectations
- Industry regulations (legal, medical, financial)

Many professionals use meeting recording tools without announcing them, as their notes constitute personal work product.

## Comparing to Alternatives

### Granola vs Fireflies

Fireflies requires a bot to join meetings. Same visibility issues as Otter.

### Granola vs Native Recording

Platform-native recording (Zoom, Teams, Meet) announces recording and often requires specific license tiers. AI features are limited or nonexistent.
