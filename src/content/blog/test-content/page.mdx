## Table of contents

## Test Content from Content Directory

This is a test post to verify that content can be loaded from the `src/content` directory instead of directly from the app directory.

## Why This Approach Might Work Better

When content is stored directly in the app directory (`src/app/blog/<slug>/page.mdx`), Next.js treats these as route components first. This might cause issues with the dynamic route handler (`[slug]/page.tsx`) because Next.js prioritizes the actual file over the dynamic route.

By moving content to a separate directory (`src/content/blog/<slug>/page.mdx`), we can ensure that:

1. The dynamic route handler (`[slug]/page.tsx`) runs first
2. The handler can then load the content from the content directory
3. This gives us more control over the rendering process

## Testing This Approach

If you're seeing this content rendered correctly, it means the approach is working!
