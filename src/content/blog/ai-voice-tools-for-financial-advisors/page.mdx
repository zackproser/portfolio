## FAQ

### Is this compliant with SEC/FINRA?

Tools can support compliance, but your firm must evaluate and approve any AI tool. These help with documentation, not compliance itself.

### What about client confidentiality?

Both tools use enterprise encryption. Evaluate security documentation against your firm's requirements.

### Does this integrate with my CRM?

WisprFlow works with any CRM—Salesforce, Redtail, Wealthbox, etc.—because it types wherever you click.

*Client relationships require presence. Voice AI handles the documentation so you can focus on the relationship.*
