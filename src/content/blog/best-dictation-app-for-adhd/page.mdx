<figcaption>Voice dictation bypasses many executive function challenges common in ADHD</figcaption>

If you have ADHD, you know the struggle: you have the idea, you know what you want to say, but getting it from your brain to the page feels like pushing through mud. The thought is there and then... it's gone.

Voice dictation changes this equation completely.

## Why Dictation Works for ADHD

### The Executive Function Problem

Typing requires:
- Holding the thought in working memory
- Translating thought to written language
- Motor planning for typing
- Spelling and grammar monitoring
- Maintaining focus on the screen

That's a lot of executive function steps. For ADHD brains, any of these can break the chain.

### The Dictation Advantage

Speaking requires:
- Having the thought
- Saying it

That's it. Two steps. The AI handles everything else.

## The Tool

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is the best dictation app for ADHD because it:
- Cleans up your speech (removes ums, fixes grammar)
- Works instantly (no setup friction)
- Runs everywhere (one tool for everything)

## How It Helps ADHD Specifically

### 1. Captures Thoughts Before They Disappear

You have an idea. Press the hotkey. Speak it. It's captured.

No more losing the thought while navigating to an app, finding the right document, positioning your cursor, and starting to type.

### 2. Reduces Initiation Friction

Starting is the hardest part. With dictation:
- See the email that needs a response
- Press hotkey
- Start talking

The activation energy is dramatically lower than typing.

### 3. Separates Creation from Editing

ADHD often involves perfectionism that blocks output. Dictation naturally separates:
- **Creation**: Just speak your thoughts
- **Editing**: Fix it later (or don't)

This reduces the paralysis of trying to get it perfect on the first pass.

### 4. Works with Hyperfocus

When you're in flow, dictation keeps up. Type at 50 WPM or speak at 170 WPM—which matches your racing thoughts better?

### 5. Movement-Friendly

Many people with ADHD think better while moving. Dictate while:
- Pacing your office
- Walking outside
- Doing light exercise

Can't do that with a keyboard.

## Practical Applications

### Email (The ADHD Nightmare)

Email accumulates because each response requires so much activation energy.

With dictation:
1. Open email
2. Press hotkey
3. "Thanks for sending that over. I've reviewed it and have a few thoughts. First, the timeline looks tight but doable. Second, I'd like to discuss the budget before we commit. Can we talk Thursday?"
4. Send

30 seconds instead of 5 minutes of avoidance.

### Notes and Documentation

Capture meeting notes, ideas, and to-dos the moment they occur. Don't trust your working memory—speak it immediately.

### Long-Form Writing

Break the blank page paralysis by talking through your points first. Edit later.

## Tips for ADHD + Dictation

### 1. Make the Hotkey Easy
Set WisprFlow's activation to something you won't forget. I use Option+Space.

### 2. Don't Edit While Dictating
Speak the whole thought. Edit after. Stopping to fix things breaks flow.

### 3. Use Movement
Walk while dictating. The physical movement often helps ADHD brains think.

### 4. Capture, Then Organize
Don't try to organize while capturing. Speak everything, sort later.

### 5. Good Enough Is Done
Dictated text is imperfect. Send it anyway. Perfect is the enemy of done.

## FAQ

### Will I sound weird talking to my computer?

You'll feel self-conscious at first. It fades fast. Most people work alone or use headphones anyway.

### What if I ramble?

WisprFlow cleans up rambling. Your "so um basically I was thinking" becomes "I was thinking." The AI helps.

### Does this work for code?

Code is harder to dictate. Dictation excels for prose—emails, documents, notes.

### Is this just an accommodation?

Call it whatever you want. If it helps you output match your brain, use it.
