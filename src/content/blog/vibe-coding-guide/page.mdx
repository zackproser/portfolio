Publishing an OpenAI key to a public repo is the software equivalent of tweeting your Amex and CVV, or strolling down Times Square throwing your credit cards at strangers' faces.

Attackers can crank out four‑figure bills (or worse, wipe data) before you notice the email from Stripe.

## The New Coder's Trap

Building with AI feels like you've hacked the system... until you:
- Get banned from API providers for policy violations  
- Wake up to $500 charges from leaked keys  
- Realize your "private" repo was public all along  

**This happens because:**  
Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Code are still tools designed for professional developers, which assume you know things like:
- How to safely manage secrets in production (and that you SHOULD be using DIFFERENT secrets for local development and production!) 
- How Git history really works  
- That API keys = credit cards  

## What actually counts as a secret?

### 🚨 Always Keep Private:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `postgres://user:password@...`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `JWT_SECRET`

**If it looks like a password or unlocks paid access, it's a secret.**

## Git = Save Game, Explained 💾

</Link>

Imagine your project is a video-game world:

| Game vibe | Git concept |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Save slot** | **Commit**: Freeze the game exactly as it is. |
| **New level / side-quest** | **Branch**: Spin up an alternate timeline safely. |
| **Cloud save** | **Remote (GitHub)**: Stores your code online for sharing. |

### Beginner loop (shortened)

```bash
git init
git add . && git commit -m "save"
git push -u origin main
```

Need to try something wild?

```bash
git checkout -b shiny-idea
# …hack away…
git switch main && git merge shiny-idea
```

Lost in the woods?

  <strong className="font-semibold">⚠️ CAUTION:</strong> This command will undo your current uncommitted work! Use only if all else fails.
</div>

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Git in Action:
1. You break your app while adding a new feature.
2. Panic? No! Run `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to revert to your last save.
3. Try again on a new branch: `git checkout -b retry-feature`.

## 3. Secrets & Environment Variables — Baby Steps 🍼

<Link href="/products/vibe-coding-mastery">
  
</Link>

**Secret** = Your code's credit card number. Leak it, pay for it.  
**Branch** = A sandbox for experiments. No branch? Bugs go live.  

**Environment variable (.env)** → a locked drawer your code can peek into at runtime so secrets don't sit in code.

Think of .env as hiding your house key under a rock outside the door. Your code knows which rock to lift; strangers do not.

Quick checklist:
- 🚫 Never paste a secret directly into .js or .ts files.
- 📁 Keep your .env file **out of Git** so it never lands on GitHub.
- 🧑‍💻 Load the variable in code with `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (Node) or framework helpers.

### 💡 Try This (Free):
Run `git add . && git commit -m "test"` to save your code.
