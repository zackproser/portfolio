## What is this?

[`automations` is a collection of shell scripts](https://github.com/zackproser/automations) that automatically handle git operations, provide local code reviews, pull requests, and more! 

These scripts leverage some of my favorite Go CLI libraries from the talented folks of [`github.com/charmbracelet`](https://github.com/charmbracelet). 

I wrote them for fun and also to save me time, and, as I continue to use them and polish them every time I find an issue, I am happy to report that they are indeed fun to use. I'm pretty sure they're making me faster as well.

## Current automations

With that out of the way, let's get into the automations themselves:

* [`autogit`](https://github.com/zackproser/automations#autogit) - ensures you're working with the latest code locally
* [`autoreview`](https://github.com/zackproser/automations#autoreview) - get a senior-level code review in your terminal 
* [`autocommitmessage`](https://github.com/zackproser/automations#autocommitmessage) - always write excellent, clear commit messages 
* [`autopullrequest`](https://github.com/zackproser/automations#autopullrequest) - open pull requests with clear titles and descriptions 

## autogit 

When you change into a new local repository, autogit runs (thanks to an alias you've configured for your shell) and ensures that your default branch is up to date with the remote. This helps prevent you from opening pull requests with stale changes.

## autoreview

Want a Senior-level code review right in your terminal to help you catch all the low-hanging fruit before you bug a human teammate? `autoreview` does just that.

Here's an example of the kind of review it can produce, and it writes the file to `~/.autoreview` so that you can revisit them or lift code from them.

## autocommitmessage

So far, this may be the automation that has saved me the most time. I love the way it works because it's not just stamping out some low quality commit message that nobody can parse out later. 

It actually describes the context of your changes pretty effectively, so it's currently hitting the sweet spot (at least for me) of combining increased speed with increased quality.

Typing my personal alias for it, `gcai`, is so fast there's no excuse for writing "check in latest" anymore.

## autopullrequest

<Image src={autopullrequestGif} alt="autopullrequest" />

This is the most recent automation, but it's pretty promising so far. It uses the official GitHub CLI, `gh` to open pull requests. It uses ChatGPT4 to generate clear, succinct and professional PR descriptions and titles, and then it opens the pull request for you. 

Here's an example pull request it recently opened for me:

## What's next? 

I'll continue improving the docs and the automations themselves. I hope to add some more automations in the future, too. I want to look into autocompletion functionality and adding installation instructions for various shells.
