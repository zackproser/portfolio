You spend 2-3 hours per day on email. What if you could cut that by 60%?

Voice-to-text for emails is the single biggest productivity hack most professionals aren't using. Here's how to do it right.

## The Tool

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is voice-to-text that works in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail—any email app. Click in the compose field, press the hotkey, speak your email, done.

<InlineAffiliateCTA product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign} />

## Speed Comparison

| Email Length | Typing Time | Dictation Time | Savings |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Short (50 words) | 1.5 min | 20 sec | 1+ min |
| Medium (150 words) | 4 min | 1 min | 3 min |
| Long (300 words) | 8 min | 2 min | 6 min |

At 30 emails per day, that's 1-2 hours saved.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Click in Email
Open Gmail, Outlook, or your email app. Click in the compose field.

### Step 2: Activate Dictation
Press WisprFlow's hotkey (customizable, I use Option+Space).

### Step 3: Speak Your Email
Talk naturally. Include the greeting, body, and sign-off.

### Step 4: Send
Review briefly, click send. Done in 30-60 seconds.

## Real Examples

### Quick Response (15 seconds)
> "Thanks for sending that over. I've reviewed the proposal and everything looks good. Let's plan to connect Thursday to discuss next steps. Talk soon."

### Detailed Reply (45 seconds)
> "Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out about the partnership opportunity. I've given this some thought and I think there's definitely potential here. A few questions: First, what's your timeline for making a decision? Second, have you explored similar partnerships before? And third, would your team be open to a pilot program before full commitment? Let me know your thoughts and we can schedule a call to dig deeper."

### Professional but Warm (30 seconds)
> "Great to hear from you, Michael. Congratulations on the promotion—well deserved. I'd love to catch up sometime over coffee if you're free in the next few weeks. My calendar is pretty open Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me know what works."

## What Makes WisprFlow Different

### AI Speech Cleanup
When you say: "So um I was thinking that uh we should probably um schedule a call"

WisprFlow outputs: "I was thinking we should schedule a call"

### Proper Formatting
The AI adds appropriate:
- Capitalization
- Punctuation
- Paragraph breaks

You get polished prose, not a raw transcript.

### Works Everywhere
Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, LinkedIn messages, Slack—anywhere you can type, you can dictate.

## Tips for Email Dictation

### 1. Start with the Greeting
"Hi [Name]" gives your brain a moment to form the rest.

### 2. Think Before Speaking
Form your key points mentally, then speak. Faster than thinking while talking.

### 3. Be Natural
Write like you talk. Dictated emails often sound more human and less templated.

### 4. Quick Review Before Send
5-second scan for obvious errors. Usually there aren't any.

### 5. Don't Over-Edit
The goal is speed. Perfect is the enemy of done.

## Best Email Types for Dictation

**Great for dictation**:
- Follow-ups
- Thank you notes
- Meeting scheduling
- Status updates
- Quick questions
- Feedback and reviews

**Less ideal for dictation**:
- Highly technical content
- Emails with many bullet points
- Content you're copying from elsewhere

## Time Savings Calculator

| Emails/Day | Time Typing (3 min avg) | Time Dictating (1 min avg) | Daily Savings |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 20 | 60 min | 20 min | 40 min |
| 30 | 90 min | 30 min | 60 min |
| 50 | 150 min | 50 min | 100 min |

That's 3-8 hours per week, depending on your email volume.

## FAQ

### What about professional tone?

You control the tone—speak professionally, get professional output. Many find dictated emails are MORE personable than typed ones.

### Does it work with email templates?

You can dictate the personalized parts and type/paste template sections. Best of both.

### What about email signatures?

Those are added by your email client, not affected by dictation.

### Can I dictate attachments?

You'd say "I've attached the document" and then attach it normally. Dictation handles the words, not the files.
