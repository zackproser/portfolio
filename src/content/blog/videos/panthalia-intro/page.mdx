I've been working on this side project for several months now, and it's ready enough to demonstrate. In this video I talk through: 
* What it is 
* How it works
* A complete live demo
* Using Replicate.com for a REST API interface to StableDiffusion XL for image generation

## Stack 
* Next.js
* Vercel 
* Vercel Postgres
* Vercel serverless functions
* Pure JavaScript integration with git and GitHub thanks to [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git)

## Features 

* Secured via GitHub oAuth
* StableDiffusion XL for image generation
* Postgres database for posts and images data
* S3 integration for semi-volatile image storage
* Start and complete high quality blog posts in MDX one-handed while on the go

Panthalia is open-source and available at [github.com/zackproser/panthalia](https://github.com/zackproser/panthalia)
