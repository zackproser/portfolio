<figcaption>Stepping out of my shell to conquer live coding anxiety.</figcaption>

For years, I carried a low-level dread of live coding interviews. I know that I am not alone in this. 

Even after over decade of shipping production software, that old whiteboard-style pressure always triggered the same mental noise: *What if I freeze?* *What if I fumble the explanation?* *What if this is when I look like a fraud?*

Recently, I figured out a couple of ways to leverage LLMs to be my personal mock interviewer. 

## Why using LLMs for interview practice is ideal

ChatGPT's advanced voice mode + livestream video can see your screen and the world and talk about it in realtime, while also 
having encyclopedic knowledge of Python programming and even anxiety disorders...

This means you can:
* explain that you're systematically desensitizing yourself against interview anxiety
* explain that sometimes you'll "step out" of the mock interview to ask the LLM questions when stuck on syntax, etc. 
* ask for progressively harder problems that flex exactly what you're trying to practice
* constantly practice speaking outloud to it and explaining your thought processes and asking clarifying questions

Meanwhile, the LLM can't properly judge or sneer at you the way a human can. 

## The Setup: Lightweight, Instant, and Transformative

I pointed my Pixel 8 at my laptop running Google Colab, then fired up a ChatGPT voice session in advanced mode. No special gear. No interview partner. Suddenly I had a private, interactive mock interview rig I could use anytime with zero friction and zero stakes.

### ChatGPT Voice Limitations

While convenient, ChatGPT's unlimited voice mode currently costs $200 per month. So there's that...

Each call is capped at roughly 15 minutes and drains a daily quota that eventually locks you out until later in the day.

I got $20 adjustable goose neck that I can clamp to anything and use to point my camera directly at my screen. Awkward, but it works!

An exciting early breakthrough, but ultimately these time limits pushed me to look for alternatives on macOS. 

That's when I discovered that Google AI Studio has screenshare capability that allows me to share a tab in Google Colab, 
and gives Gemini 2.5 the ability to see my screen and talk to me in realtime. 

## What It Let Me Do

With this setup, I could:

* Practice solving Python problems aloud, just like in a real interview
* Pause the session to ask follow-up questions or clarify concepts
* Deconstruct complexity claims ("Why is this O(n)? Can we prove it?")
* Build fluency around verbal reasoning and tradeoffs
* Rehearse edge cases and reflect on design decisions in real time

ChatGPT became the interviewer and I became the candidate in the hot seat.

### Trying Google AI Studio Instead

Google AI Studio's screen-share feature lets the model see just my Google Colab tab. The experience is even smoother—no phone mount, no juggling devices, and the model can read my code as I type.

## Why It Works: Exposure Without Shame

The novelty isn't the tech—it's the emotional dynamic. Because this practice environment is lightweight and private, I don't feel self-conscious when I fumble or need to restart. There's no judgment and no ticking clock. It's systematic desensitization: controlled exposure that chips away at the fear of being judged while coding.

## The Outcome: More Confidence, Less Panic

Each session leaves me a little calmer. I'm not memorizing answers; I'm getting comfortable with ambiguity, silence, and mid-solution pivots. It's a low-cost way to reinforce fundamentals, get quick feedback, and push into tougher problems without burning out.

## How You Can Try This

You don't need much to replicate it:

1. Open a coding environment—Google Colab, VS Code, whatever you like
2. Launch ChatGPT in voice mode with advanced features
3. Record your screen if you want visual feedback
4. Start talking and solving—narrate, question, revise, and reflect
5. Repeat, noticing how each session feels a little easier than the last

You can even ask ChatGPT to role-play different interviewer styles: skeptical, friendly, curious, or silent.

## Closing Thought

This isn't just about acing an interview—it's about reclaiming the mental real estate that fear was occupying. If live coding anxiety has been holding you back, this gentle, high-leverage approach can help you move through it. Confidence isn't innate; it's built one conversation, one problem, one quiet win at a time.
