Whether you can't type (injury, disability, preference), don't want to type (meetings, interviews), or just want to be faster, there are excellent options for taking notes without a keyboard.

Here's the complete guide.

## The Options

### 1. Automatic Meeting Capture

For meetings, the best option is automatic transcription.

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures any meeting—Zoom, Teams, phone calls, in-person—and creates notes automatically. You don't type, speak, or do anything. Just attend the meeting.

**Best for**: Video calls, phone calls, in-person meetings

### 2. Voice Dictation

For your own thoughts and notes, speak them.

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> turns your speech into text anywhere on your computer. Press a hotkey, speak, and text appears.

**Best for**: Personal notes, quick captures, documentation

### 3. Combination Approach

Use both:
- **Granola** for meeting capture (passive)
- **WisprFlow** for your own notes (active)

This covers virtually all note-taking scenarios without typing.

## Comparison of Methods

| Scenario | Best Method | Tool |

## Accessibility Considerations

### For Mobility Limitations
Voice dictation removes the need for fine motor control required by typing. WisprFlow works with any microphone—built-in, headset, or specialized.

### For Visual Processing Differences
Speaking is often easier than the visual-motor coordination of typing. The auditory-verbal path may be more natural.

### For Temporary Injuries
Broken arm? RSI flare-up? Voice tools let you keep working while healing.

## FAQ

### Can I really never type?

For most note-taking, yes. You might occasionally type for special characters or corrections, but 95%+ can be voice.

### What about code or technical content?

Prose works great. Code and math are harder to dictate. Consider voice for documentation and typing for code.

### Is the quality good enough?

Modern AI transcription is excellent. Both tools produce clean, usable text.

### What about in quiet offices?

Use a headset with a noise-canceling microphone. Your voice goes directly to the mic, not through the room.
