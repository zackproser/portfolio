This is a brief story about the best programmer I've ever worked with.

A few years ago I worked with a celebrity developer who wrote the book on an entire category of technical pursuit.

This was pre-ChatGPT, and this rare human could produce entire applications overnight even in languages they didn't know well that worked perfectly and appeared idiomatically written.

In a one on one I asked if this person ever got stuck or frustrated despite their abnormal skill level and many decades of experience.

Their response?

"All the time".
