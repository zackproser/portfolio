<figcaption>Voice AI tools help researchers capture interviews and write faster</figcaption>

Research is about capturing insights—from interviews, literature, experiments, and your own thinking. But the mechanical work of transcription and documentation steals time from actual analysis.

Voice AI tools handle the tedious capture so you can focus on what matters: understanding.

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures your interviews and creates searchable transcripts—essential for qualitative research.

### For Qualitative Research

**Participant interviews**: Focus on the conversation, not transcription. Capture nuances you'd miss while writing.

**No visible recording**: Participants may speak more freely without obvious recording. Granola runs invisibly.

**Searchable transcripts**: Find that quote you remember but can't locate. Search across all your interviews.

### Research Use Cases

- **Semi-structured interviews**: Follow the conversation naturally
- **Focus groups**: Capture multiple voices
- **Field observations**: Mobile app for in-person research
- **Advisor meetings**: Record feedback for later review

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> lets you dictate literature notes, paper sections, and research documentation at speaking speed.

### Academic Writing

**Literature notes**: Dictate summaries and reactions while reading papers. Capture thoughts immediately.

**First drafts**: Speak your arguments before committing to text. Many researchers find this clarifies thinking.

**Grant writing**: Get words on paper faster. Edit later.

**Email correspondence**: Quick responses to collaborators and advisors.

## Researcher Workflow

### During Data Collection
- Granola captures participant interviews
- Dictate field notes via WisprFlow
- Voice memos for observations

### During Analysis
- Search interview transcripts for themes
- Dictate coding notes and memos
- Speak through emerging interpretations

### During Writing
- Dictate sections while ideas are fresh
- Literature review summaries by voice
- Quick revision passes

### Time Savings

| Task | Traditional | With Voice AI | Savings |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Interview transcription | 4 hrs/hr audio | 0 (auto) | 4 hrs |
| Literature notes | 2 hrs/day | 45 min/day | 75 min |
| First draft writing | 500 words/hr | 1500 words/hr | 3x faster |

## FAQ

### Is this IRB compliant?

Consult your IRB. Recording requirements vary by protocol. Many researchers use these tools with appropriate consent procedures.

### What about confidential participant data?

Both tools use encryption. Evaluate their security documentation against your data management plan requirements.

### Does dictation work for technical writing?

Yes, though equations and citations need manual entry. Prose sections benefit most.
