## WisprFlow for Essays and Assignments

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is voice-to-text that works in any app on your Mac. Speak your essay, and polished text appears in Google Docs, Word, or whatever you use.

### Why Students Use WisprFlow

**Write essays faster**: Speaking is 3x faster than typing. A 1,500-word essay takes 10 minutes to dictate vs. 30+ minutes typing.

**Works everywhere**: Google Docs, Word, Canvas, Blackboard—if you can type there, you can dictate there.

**Cleans up your speech**: Removes filler words, fixes grammar, adds punctuation. You get polished prose, not a messy transcript.

### Student Use Cases

- **Essays and papers**: Dictate your arguments and ideas, then polish on screen
- **Discussion posts**: Quick responses that would take 10 minutes to type take 2 minutes to speak
- **Study notes**: Talk through concepts to reinforce learning while creating study materials
- **Email to professors**: Professional correspondence in seconds

### The "Explain It Out Loud" Study Hack

You've probably heard that teaching something helps you learn it. Dictating your understanding works the same way—you're forced to articulate concepts clearly.

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures audio and creates organized notes automatically. No more frantically scribbling while the professor moves on.

### Perfect for Students

**Lecture capture**: Record lectures (where allowed) and get searchable transcripts. Never miss a point because you were writing.

**Study group sessions**: Capture group discussions. Review what everyone contributed later.

**Office hours**: Record conversations with professors about assignments or concepts.

**No visible recording**: Granola runs in the background. No awkward "is that thing recording?" moments.

### Note Quality vs. Attention

Studies show students retain more when they listen actively vs. transcribing. Granola lets you listen while still having complete notes.

## FAQ

### Is this cheating?

No. You're still doing the thinking and creating the content. These tools just make the mechanical process faster—like how spell check doesn't write your paper for you.

### Does it work with my school's LMS?

Yes. WisprFlow works with Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, and any web-based system because it operates at the system level.

### Can I record lectures legally?

Check your institution's policy. Many allow recording for personal use. Granola's invisible operation means you don't disturb the class.

### What about group projects?

Perfect use case. Record brainstorming sessions, capture meeting notes, and dictate your portions of the project.
