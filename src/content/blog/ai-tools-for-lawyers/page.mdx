<figcaption>Modern AI voice tools are transforming how lawyers draft documents and capture meetings</figcaption>

Legal work is word-intensive. Contracts, briefs, motions, client emails, meeting notes—the volume of text lawyers produce is staggering. Voice AI tools are now good enough to meaningfully reduce this burden while maintaining the precision legal work demands.

This guide covers two tools I've found particularly effective for professional document work: one for dictation and one for meeting capture.

## The Tools

## WisprFlow for Legal Dictation

[WisprFlow](https://ref.wisprflow.ai/zack-proser) is a voice-to-text application that works system-wide on Mac. Speak naturally, and polished text appears wherever your cursor is focused—Word, Outlook, your document management system, anywhere.

### Legal-Specific Benefits

**Draft correspondence faster**: Client emails, opposing counsel letters, and internal memos can be dictated rather than typed. The AI removes filler words and properly formats the output.

**Works with legal terminology**: WisprFlow learns your vocabulary. After a few uses, it recognizes case names, legal phrases, and party names specific to your matters.

**Dictate into any application**: Whether you're using Clio, MyCase, NetDocuments, or plain Word, WisprFlow works because it operates at the system level.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Email responses**: Dictate a 300-word response in 90 seconds instead of typing for 5 minutes
- **First drafts**: Speak through the structure of a motion or memo before refining
- **Time entries**: Dictate detailed time descriptions directly into your billing software
- **Notes to file**: Document client calls and strategy sessions immediately after they happen

### Speed Comparison

Average typing speed: 40-60 WPM
WisprFlow voice speed: 150-180 WPM
**Effective improvement: 2-3x faster initial drafts**

## Granola for Client Meetings and Depositions

<a href="https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

</a>

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) captures meeting audio and generates structured notes without a bot joining your call. This distinction matters significantly in legal contexts.

### Why "No Bot" Matters for Lawyers

Other meeting transcription tools join calls as a visible participant, announcing their presence. This can:

- Make clients uncomfortable discussing sensitive matters
- Alert opposing counsel that the meeting is being recorded
- Create awkward interruptions at the start of every call

Granola captures audio from your device's microphone. The recording is invisible to other participants.

### Legal Use Cases

**Client intake calls**: Capture everything the client says without breaking eye contact to type notes. Review later to ensure you didn't miss critical facts.

**Deposition preparation**: Use the mobile app to record witness preparation sessions. Granola extracts key points and potential issues.

**Settlement negotiations**: Focus on negotiating, not note-taking. The transcript preserves exactly what was offered and discussed.

**Team meetings**: Strategy sessions generate automatic action items. No more "who was supposed to do what?"

### Privacy and Security

- Enterprise-grade encryption
- Audio processed securely
- No data used to train AI models
- See their [trust center](https://trust.granola.ai/) for compliance details

## Addressing Common Concerns

### Attorney-Client Privilege

Both tools process data with encryption. However, firms should review their data handling policies and consider:

- Where data is stored
- Retention policies
- Access controls

Neither tool retains data longer than necessary for processing, but due diligence is always appropriate.

### Court Reporter Replacement?

These tools don't replace official court reporters or certified transcriptionists for record purposes. They're productivity tools for internal work product and informal meetings.

### Accuracy for Legal Terminology

WisprFlow's personal dictionary feature learns specialized vocabulary. After initial corrections, it reliably recognizes:

- Case names (Smith v. Jones)
- Legal phrases (voir dire, res judicata)
- Client and party names
- Court names and judge names

## Recommended Workflow

### For a typical client meeting:

1. **Before**: Have Granola synced with your calendar (automatic meeting detection)
2. **During**: Focus on the client. Take minimal notes if any.
3. **After**: Review Granola's summary and action items. Use WisprFlow to dictate your notes-to-file.

### For document drafting:

1. Outline the document structure (can be dictated)
2. Dictate the substance section by section
3. Review and refine in your word processor
4. Use voice for revisions: "Delete the second paragraph and replace with..."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the recording admissible in court?

These tools create internal work product, not official records. For evidentiary recordings, consult applicable rules and use appropriate certified services.

### Can I use this at depositions I'm taking?

For your own notes and reference, yes. This doesn't replace the official court reporter transcript.

### What about consent requirements?

Check your jurisdiction's recording consent laws. Many states are one-party consent, meaning you can record conversations you're part of. Granola's non-visible approach doesn't change this legal analysis.

### Does my firm need to approve these tools?

Recommended. IT and ethics committees should review any tool that processes client communications. Both tools have enterprise options with additional controls.

*The billable hour won't wait for you to type. Voice AI tools offer a meaningful way to reclaim time without sacrificing quality—time you can spend on substantive legal work or, occasionally, on something other than work.*
