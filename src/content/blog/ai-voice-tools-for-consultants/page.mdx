<figcaption>Voice AI tools help consultants capture client insights and deliver faster</figcaption>

Consulting is a knowledge business. The faster you can capture client insights and turn them into deliverables, the more value you provide—and the more you can bill.

Voice AI tools eliminate the friction between client conversations and polished deliverables.

## The Tools

## Granola for Client Meetings

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>

</AffiliateLink>

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures your meetings and creates structured notes with action items—without a bot joining your call.

### Why Consultants Need This

**Client calls without distraction**: Discovery calls, status updates, and strategy sessions require your full attention. Granola captures everything while you focus on the client.

**No "recording bot" awkwardness**: Other tools join calls visibly, making clients self-conscious. Granola runs invisibly—clients speak freely.

**Automatic action items**: Every meeting ends with a clear list of who owes what. No more "let me review my notes."

### Consulting Use Cases

- **Discovery calls**: Capture everything the client says about their problems. Review later for insights you might have missed.
- **Stakeholder interviews**: Multiple interviews across an organization, all searchable and organized.
- **Steering committee meetings**: Complex discussions with executives, fully documented.
- **Workshop facilitation**: Capture participant input while staying present in the room.

</AffiliateLink>

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is voice-to-text that works in PowerPoint, Word, Excel—everywhere you create deliverables.

### Deliverable Speed

**Proposals in minutes**: Dictate your approach, methodology, and pricing. Edit on screen.

**Slide decks**: Speak your bullet points and findings. Formatting happens in the tool.

**Reports**: Turn interview notes into written findings at 170 WPM instead of 50 WPM.

**Client emails**: Detailed status updates and recommendations in seconds.

### The Billable Hour Math

If you bill $300/hour and voice tools save you 10 hours per month on documentation, that's either:
- $3,000 more revenue from additional billable work
- 10 hours back for business development or personal time

**Week 2-3: Analysis**
- Reference interview transcripts while analyzing
- Dictate observations and recommendations
- Build presentation by speaking through each slide

**Week 4: Delivery**

### Time Savings

| Task | Traditional | With Voice AI | Weekly Savings |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Meeting notes | 1 hr/day | 0 (auto) | 5 hrs |
| Deliverable writing | 10 hrs | 4 hrs | 6 hrs |
| Client emails | 5 hrs | 2 hrs | 3 hrs |
| **Total** | | | **14 hrs** |

That's nearly two full days recovered every week.

## FAQ

### Can I share transcripts with clients?

Yes, if appropriate. Granola exports to multiple formats. Some consultants share cleaned-up transcripts as meeting summaries.

### What about confidentiality?

Both tools use enterprise-grade encryption. Review their security documentation for client-sensitive engagements.

### Does this work for Big 4 / MBB firms?

The tools work anywhere. Firm policies on recording and AI tools vary—check with your practice leadership.

### Can I dictate into my firm's templates?

Yes. WisprFlow works at the system level, so it works with PowerPoint, Word, custom templates, and proprietary tools.
