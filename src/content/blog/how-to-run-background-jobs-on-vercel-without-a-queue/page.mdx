Have you ever wanted to return a response immediately from a Vercel API route while still performing long-running tasks in the background? Would you rather not pay for a queue or add another component to your architecture? 

In this post I'll demonstrate how you can keep your job-accepting API route snappy while still performing long-running or resource intensive processing in the background - without impacting your end-users. 
## The problems

I recently needed to solve the following problems with my Next.js application deployed on Vercel: 
1. **I needed my job-accepting API route to return a response quickly**. 
1. **I had expensive and slow work to perform in the background for each new job**. 		
1. **Time is not unlimited.** Vercel capped function invocation timeouts at 5 minutes for Pro plan users. I didn't want to risk doing so much work in one API route that it was likely I'd hit the timeout. I wanted to divvy up the work.

## The solution 

The solution is to use a fire and forget function. Forget, in the sense that we're not awaiting the response from the long-running process. 

Here's what my fire-and-forget function looks like in my app [Panthalia](https://github.com/zackproser/panthalia): 

```javascript

  

  try {
    await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/jobs`, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(post),
    }).then(() => {
      console.log(`Finished updating existing post via git`)
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`error: ${error}`);
  }
}

```

This is a React Server Component (RSC) by default because it does not include the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file, and because Next.js routes default to being server components. 

Because this is a server component, we actually have to determine the `${baseUrl}` for our API call - whereas you may be familiar with calling fetch on a partial API route like so: 

`await fetch('/api/jobs', {})`

in our server component we must supply a fully qualified URL to fetch. 

### Calling functions that call other API routes

The `startBackgroundJobs` function is really just an API call to a separate route, `/api/jobs` which POSTs to that route the information about the new post including its ID.

Everything that other route needs to start processing work in a separate invocation. Meanwhile, the `startBackgroundJobs` call itself is quick because it's making a request and returning. 

This means the API route can immediately return a response to the client after accepting the new task for processing: 

```javascript


// This route accepts new blog posts created by the Panthalia client
// It calls a function, `startBackgroundJobs` which itself calls a separate 
// API route, passing the information necessary to continue processing 
// long-running jobs that will operate on the post data
// Meanwhile, the client receives a response immediately and is freed up to
// create more posts
  try {
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

    if (!session) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 })
    }

    const formData = await request.json()

    const {
      title,
      slug,
      summary,
      content,
      ...formImagePrompts
    } = formData

    // Query to insert new blog post into the database
    const result = await sql`
      INSERT INTO posts(
      title,
      slug,
      summary,
      content,
      status
    )
      VALUES(
      ${title},
      ${slug},
      ${summary},
      ${content},
      'drafting'
    )
      RETURNING *;
    `;

    // Save the postId so we can use it to update the record with the pull request URL once it's available
    const newPost: Post = {
      id: result.rows[0].id,
      title,
      slug,
      summary,
      content,
      gitbranch: null,
      githubpr: null,
    }

    const promptsToProcess = formImagePrompts.imagePrompts as imagePrompt[]

    // Query to insert images into the database
    for (const promptToProcess of promptsToProcess) {
    
      const imgInsertResult = await sql`
        INSERT INTO 
        images(
          post_id,
          prompt_text)
         VALUES(
          ${newPost.id},
          ${promptToProcess.text}
        )
      `
    }

    // Fire and forget the initial post setup (git operations) and the image generation tasks
    startBackgroundJobs(newPost);

    // Because we're not awaiting the response from the long-running job, we can immediately return a response to the client 
    return NextResponse.json({ result, success: true }, { status: 200 });

  } catch (error) {

    console.log(`error: ${error} `);

    return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 500 });

  }
}

```

## Wrapping up 

And there you have it. Using this pattern, you can return a response to your client immediately to keep your application quick and responsive, while simultaneously handling longer-running jobs in a separate execution context.
