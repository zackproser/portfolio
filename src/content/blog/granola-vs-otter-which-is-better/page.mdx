<figcaption>Granola and Otter.ai take very different approaches to meeting transcription</figcaption>

Looking for a meeting notes app but can't decide between Granola and Otter.ai? They solve the same problem in fundamentally different ways.

Here's the real comparison.

## Quick Answer

**<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink>** is better for most users. It captures meetings without a bot joining your call, which means participants behave naturally. Otter's visible bot changes the meeting dynamic.

## The Core Difference

### Granola: Device Audio Capture
- Captures audio from your device's microphone
- No one knows it's running
- Works on any platform (Zoom, Teams, Meet, phone calls)
- Participants speak naturally

### Otter.ai: Bot Joins Meeting
- A visible "Otter.ai" bot joins your call
- Announces recording to all participants
- Can be blocked by meeting hosts
- Changes how people speak

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Granola | Otter.ai |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Visible to participants | No | Yes (bot joins) |
| Works on any platform | Yes | Most, but can be blocked |
| In-person meetings | Yes (mobile app) | No |
| Free tier | Trial | Yes, limited |
| Action item extraction | Automatic | Manual |
| Participant comfort | High | Lower |
| Enterprise compliance | Good | Good |

## When Otter's Bot Is a Problem

**Scenario 1: Client Call**
You: "Hi Sarah, thanks for joining."
Otter: "Otter.ai Bot has joined the meeting."
Sarah: "Oh... are you recording this?"

The conversation shifts. Sarah becomes more guarded. You spend 2 minutes explaining instead of building rapport.

**Scenario 2: Sales Call**
Prospect sees "Otter.ai is recording" and wonders what you'll do with it. Trust takes a hit.

**Scenario 3: Sensitive Internal Discussion**
Team members notice the bot. The frank conversation you needed becomes more political.

## When Otter Makes Sense

- **Internal team meetings** where recording is expected
- **Organizations that require visible recording** for compliance
- **Users who need a free tier** for occasional use
- **Teams already using Otter** with established workflows

## Granola Advantages

### 1. Natural Conversation
When participants don't see recording, they speak naturally. You get:
- More honest feedback
- Less guarded client conversations
- Better meeting dynamics

### 2. Universal Platform Support
Works on Zoom, Teams, Meet, WebEx, phone calls—anything your device can hear. Otter bots can be blocked on some platforms.

### 3. In-Person Meetings
Granola's mobile app captures in-person meetings. Otter is video calls only.

### 4. Cleaner Action Items
Granola automatically extracts action items with owners. Otter requires manual highlighting.

## Otter Advantages

### 1. Free Tier
Otter offers a limited free version. Granola requires subscription after trial.

### 2. Established Brand
Otter has been around longer and has more integrations.

### 3. Visible Recording
If you *want* participants to know they're recorded (compliance, consent), Otter makes it obvious.

## Pricing Comparison

| Plan | Granola | Otter.ai |
|------|---------|----------|
| Free | Trial only | 300 min/month |
| Pro | ~$10-20/month | ~$17/month |
| Business | Custom | ~$30/month |

## My Recommendation

For most professionals: **<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Start with Granola</AffiliateLink>**.

The invisible capture changes everything. Meetings are better when people aren't thinking about the recording.

Use Otter if:
- You need free tier for light use
- Your organization requires visible recording
- You're already embedded in Otter workflows

## FAQ

### Is invisible recording ethical?

You're still responsible for consent laws in your jurisdiction. "Invisible" means to other participants—you know it's running.

### Can I switch from Otter to Granola?

Yes. They're separate accounts. Try Granola on your next few meetings and compare.

### What about transcript accuracy?

Both are good. Modern AI transcription is quite accurate. Minor errors in both, similar quality.

### Does Granola have an API?

Check their docs for current integrations. Both tools have export options.

*The best meeting notes tool is one that doesn't change the meeting. Granola wins on this.*
