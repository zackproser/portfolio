<figcaption>Voice AI tools help therapists focus on clients instead of documentation</figcaption>

Documentation is one of the biggest time drains in mental health practice. Progress notes, treatment plans, and session summaries take hours that could be spent with clients or on self-care.

Voice AI tools can cut documentation time significantly while maintaining clinical quality.

## WisprFlow for Clinical Documentation

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> is voice-to-text that works in your EHR, Word, or any system where you document.

### Why Therapists Use WisprFlow

**Dictate notes between sessions**: Speak your progress notes immediately after a session while details are fresh. Takes 2 minutes instead of 10.

**Works with any EHR**: SimplePractice, TherapyNotes, Jane App—WisprFlow works at the system level, so it types wherever you click.

**Professional output**: AI removes filler words and formats properly. You get clinical documentation, not a transcript.

### Clinical Use Cases

- **Progress notes**: Dictate immediately after sessions. "Client presented with..." flows naturally when spoken.
- **Treatment plans**: Speak through goals, objectives, and interventions.
- **Intake summaries**: Long initial assessments become manageable when dictated.
- **Letters and referrals**: Professional correspondence in seconds.

### The 10-Minute Rule

Many therapists try to document during the 10 minutes between sessions. Voice makes this realistic—2-3 minutes of dictation captures what 10 minutes of typing couldn't.

## Granola for Supervision and Consultation

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures conversations without visible recording—useful for supervision, consultation, and team meetings.

### Appropriate Use Cases

**Supervision sessions**: Capture your supervisor's guidance for later review. Focus on learning, not note-taking.

**Peer consultation**: Group discussions about clinical challenges, fully documented.

**Team meetings**: Case conferences and treatment team meetings captured automatically.

**Training and workshops**: Professional development sessions you can review later.

**Note**: Granola is NOT appropriate for recording therapy sessions without explicit client consent. These use cases are for professional-to-professional conversations.

## Privacy Considerations

### For Session Notes (WisprFlow)

WisprFlow processes your dictation—you're speaking your notes, not recording client sessions. This is no different from typing notes, just faster.

### For Consultation (Granola)

Use only for professional conversations where all parties consent. Not for client sessions.

### General Security

Both tools use encryption. Review their security documentation and consider your practice's specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, state regulations, etc.).

## Therapist Workflow

### Daily Practice
1. **Before session**: Review previous notes
2. **During session**: Be fully present
3. **After session**: 2-minute dictated progress note via WisprFlow
4. **End of day**: Review and finalize documentation

### Weekly
- Supervision captured by Granola for later review
- Dictate any letters, referrals, or treatment plan updates
- Administrative tasks completed by voice

### Time Savings

| Task | Traditional | With Voice AI | Daily Savings |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Progress notes (6 clients) | 60 min | 15 min | 45 min |
| Correspondence | 20 min | 5 min | 15 min |
| **Total** | **80 min** | **20 min** | **1 hour** |

That's 5+ hours per week returned to clinical work or personal time.

## FAQ

### Is this HIPAA compliant?

Tools can be configured for compliance, but your practice must evaluate any AI tool that touches client information. WisprFlow processes your spoken words (your notes), not recordings of clients.

### Can I record sessions with clients?

That's a separate ethical and legal question. These tools are for YOUR documentation efficiency, not session recording.

### Does dictation work with clinical terminology?

Yes. WisprFlow learns your vocabulary. DSM terminology, medication names, and therapeutic modalities are recognized accurately.

### What about accents or speech patterns?

Modern AI handles diverse speech patterns well. Accuracy improves with use as the system learns your voice.

*Paperwork burnout is real. Voice AI won't solve systemic issues in mental health, but it can give individual practitioners meaningful time back.*
