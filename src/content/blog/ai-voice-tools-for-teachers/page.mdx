<figcaption>Voice AI tools help teachers spend less time on paperwork and more time teaching</figcaption>

Teachers spend an estimated 10+ hours per week on administrative tasks—lesson plans, grading feedback, parent communications, IEP documentation. That's time stolen from actual teaching.

Voice AI tools can cut that admin time significantly.

### Teacher Use Cases

- **Essay feedback**: Speak thoughtful comments at 3x typing speed
- **IEP documentation**: Required reports become manageable
- **Lesson plans**: Outline a week's lessons in one voice session
- **Sub plans**: Emergency coverage notes in minutes

## FAQ

### Does this work with Google Classroom?

Yes. WisprFlow works with Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology, PowerSchool—any web-based or desktop system.

### Is dictated feedback as good as typed?

Often better. Teachers report giving more detailed, personal feedback because speaking is faster. Students get more guidance, not less.

### What about classroom recordings?

These tools are for YOUR documentation efficiency. Recording students requires different considerations (consent, policies, etc.).
