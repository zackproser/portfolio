At the time of this writing, there **are** [official docs on building a sitemap for your Next.js 
project](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap) that uses the newer app router pattern. 

However, they're on the sparse side, and there's more than a little confusion going around about 
how to pull this off based on the npm packages and GitHub issues I encountered when doing 
my own research. 

When you're finished this post, you'll have the knowledge and code you need to build a dynamic sitemap 
for your Next.js project that includes both 'static' routes such as `/about` or `/home`
and dynamic routes such as `/blog/[id]/page.tsx` or `/posts/[slug]/page.js`.

You can also feel free to skip ahead to the implementation below. This is what I used to get a working sitemap that 
included all the routes I cared about and, more importantly, was accepted by Google Search's console / robots:

## Key things to understand 

Here's the things I needed to know upfront when I wanted to build my own sitemap: 

### The Next.js file to route convention is supported
 
You can use the file-convention approach, meaning that a file that lives at `src/app/sitemap.(js|ts)` 

Your file should export a default function - conventionally named `sitemap`. I've demonstrated this in the 
implementation example below.

### You can test your sitemap locally
To test your sitemap, you can use curl like `curl http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml > /tmp/sitemap.xml` and I recommend redirecting 
the output to a file as shown so that you can examine it more closely. 

At a minimum, all of the URLs you want search engines and other readers of sitemaps to be aware of need to be present in this file 
and wrapped in `<loc>` or location tags. 

If your sitemap is missing key URLs you're looking to get indexed, there's something wrong in your logic causing your routes to be excluded.

You can do print debugging and add logging statments throughout you sitemap file so that when you're running `npm run dev` and you curl 
your sitemap, you can see the output in your terminal to help you diagnose what's going on.

## Next.js dynamic and static sitemap.xml example

The following implementation creates a sitemap out of [my portfolio project](https://github.com/zackproser/portfolio). 

It works by defining the root directory of the project (`src/app`), and then reading all the directories it finds there, applying the following rules: 

1. If the sub-directory is named `blog` or `videos`, it is a dynamic route, which needs to be recursively read for individual posts
2. If the sub-directory is not named `blog` or `videos`, it is a static or top-level route, and processing can stop after obtaining the entry name. This will be the case
for any top-level pages such as `/photos` or `/subscribe`, for example.

Note that if you're copy-pasting this into your own file, you need to update: 
1. your `baseUrl` variable, since it's currently pointing to my domain
2. the names of your dynamic directories. For my current site version, I only have `/blog` and `/videos` set up as dynamic routes
3. Your excludeDirs. I added this because I didn't want my API routes that support backend functionality in my sitemap

```javascript


function getRoutes() {
  const fullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), baseDir);
  const entries = fs.readdirSync(fullPath, { withFileTypes: true });
  let routes = [];

  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isDirectory() && !excludeDirs.includes(entry.name)) {
      // Handle 'static' routes at the baseDir
      routes.push(`/${entry.name}`);

      // Handle dynamic routes 
      if (dynamicDirs.includes(entry.name)) {
        const subDir = path.join(fullPath, entry.name);
        const subEntries = fs.readdirSync(subDir, { withFileTypes: true });

        subEntries.forEach(subEntry => {
          if (subEntry.isDirectory()) {
            routes.push(`/${entry.name}/${subEntry.name}`);
          }
        });
      }
    }
  });

  return routes.map(route => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}${route}`,
    lastModified: new Date(),
    changeFrequency: 'weekly',
    priority: 1.0,
  }));
}

function sitemap() {
  return getRoutes();
}

```

That's it! Save this code to your `src/app/sitemap.js` file and test it as described above.
