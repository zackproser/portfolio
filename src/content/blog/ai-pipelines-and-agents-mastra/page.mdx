On June 3rd, 2025, my colleague **Nick Nisi** and I hosted a two hour workshop at the **AI Engineer World Fair** in San Francisco. The event gathered more than 70 engineers eager to build AI powered workflows in their own products.

Mastra.ai provided an early preview of their workflow tooling, which allows you to orchestrate tasks using pure TypeScript. We showed how to chain those workflows together into pipelines and grant access to them through natural language driven agents.

All of the materials are open source in the [mastra-agents-meme-generator](https://github.com/workos/mastra-agents-meme-generator) repo. We built the full app first, wrote up the steps in `workshop.md`, and staged each phase on a separate git branch so everyone could work at their own pace.

The hands-on format let attendees build a simple pipeline from scratch, then wrap it with an agent interface. Seeing the agents successfully complete tasks through our pipelines was an awesome moment for everyone in the room.

One of us stayed on the mic while the other roamed the room answering questions and fixing issues. This tag-team approach kept everyone moving forward and made sure no one fell behind.

We tied the workshop back to lessons from my [earlier talk at a16z](/blog/a16z-sf-dec-2023-ai-apps-production) about taking prototypes to production. This time, it was all coded live in TypeScript with the Mastra.ai SDK.

By the end, almost every attendee succeeded in getting the finished agent running. The energy in the room was incredible, and we were fired up by how many developers were brainstorming ways to use Mastra.ai in their own workflows. We can't wait to run more of these sessions in the future.
