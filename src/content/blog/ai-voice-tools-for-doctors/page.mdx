<figcaption>Modern AI voice tools are helping physicians reclaim hours spent on documentation</figcaption>

Clinical documentation is one of the leading causes of physician burnout. Studies show doctors spend 2 hours on EHR documentation for every 1 hour of patient care. Voice AI tools are now accurate enough to meaningfully reduce this burden.

This guide covers practical voice tools for clinical documentation, with attention to privacy concerns specific to healthcare.

## The Tools

## WisprFlow for Clinical Dictation

<a href="https://ref.wisprflow.ai/zack-proser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

</a>

[WisprFlow](https://ref.wisprflow.ai/zack-proser) is a voice-to-text application that works system-wide. Speak naturally, and polished text appears wherever your cursor is—Epic, Cerner, your EHR of choice.

### Why Physicians Choose WisprFlow

**Works with any EHR**: WisprFlow operates at the operating system level. It doesn't need special integration—if you can type there, you can dictate there.

**Learns medical terminology**: The personal dictionary feature learns your specialty's vocabulary. After initial training, it recognizes drug names, procedures, and anatomical terms accurately.

**Faster than typing**: Most physicians type 30-50 WPM. WisprFlow enables 150-180 WPM dictation. That's a 3-4x improvement on documentation speed.

### Clinical Use Cases

- **Progress notes**: Dictate assessments and plans during or immediately after patient encounters
- **Discharge summaries**: Speak through complex discharge instructions faster than typing
- **Referral letters**: Generate professional correspondence in minutes
- **Chart review notes**: Document your review findings hands-free

I've written a [detailed WisprFlow review](/blog/wisprflow-review) covering setup, accuracy, and real-world performance.

## Granola for Patient Consultations

</a>

[Granola](https://go.granola.ai/zack-proser) captures conversations and creates structured notes without a visible recorder joining your meeting.

### Applications in Healthcare

**Telemedicine visits**: Granola runs in the background during video consultations, capturing the entire conversation. Focus on the patient instead of typing.

**Team rounds**: Capture discussions during rounds automatically. Review later to ensure nothing was missed.

**Family conferences**: Complex discussions about care plans are fully documented without manual note-taking.

**Peer consultations**: Phone calls with specialists are captured and summarized.

For a detailed comparison, see my [Granola vs Otter.ai review](/blog/granola-vs-otter).

## Privacy Considerations

### HIPAA and Voice AI

Important caveats for healthcare settings:

1. **Consult your compliance team** before using any AI tool with patient information
2. **Review data handling policies** of any tool you consider
3. **Consider BAA requirements** - does the vendor offer a Business Associate Agreement?

Both WisprFlow and Granola process data with encryption, but healthcare facilities should conduct their own security reviews.

### Local vs. Cloud Processing

- **WisprFlow**: Processes locally where possible, with cloud backup for some features
- **Granola**: Cloud-based processing with enterprise security options

For detailed privacy policies, visit each vendor's trust center.

## Workflow Integration

### Before Patient Encounter
- Review chart in EHR
- Have WisprFlow ready (hotkey activation)

### During Encounter
- Focus on the patient
- If telemedicine: Granola captures automatically
- If in-person: Use WisprFlow to dictate key points immediately after

### After Encounter
- Dictate full note using WisprFlow
- Review Granola transcript if applicable
- Copy relevant portions to EHR

### Time Savings

| Task | Traditional | With Voice AI | Savings |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Progress note | 8 min | 3 min | 5 min |
| Discharge summary | 15 min | 5 min | 10 min |
| Referral letter | 10 min | 3 min | 7 min |

At 20 patients per day, that's potentially 2+ hours saved daily.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this HIPAA compliant?

Tools themselves can be configured for compliance, but your organization must evaluate and approve any tool that handles PHI. Work with your compliance officer.

### Does this replace medical transcriptionists?

For routine documentation, yes, these tools can reduce or eliminate the need for transcription services. For complex or specialized documentation, human review remains valuable.

### Can I use this in the exam room?

WisprFlow works anywhere you can speak. Some physicians dictate notes immediately after leaving the room. Others review and dictate during documentation time.

### What about ambient clinical documentation?

Products like Nuance DAX offer ambient capture specifically for healthcare. WisprFlow and Granola are general-purpose tools that work across your entire workflow, not just clinical encounters.

*Every minute spent on documentation is a minute not spent with patients. These tools won't solve healthcare's systemic issues, but they can give individual physicians meaningful time back.*
