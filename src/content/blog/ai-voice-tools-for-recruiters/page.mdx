<figcaption>Voice AI tools help recruiters capture every candidate detail and move faster</figcaption>

Recruiting is a speed game. The recruiter who captures better candidate intel and follows up faster wins the placement. But typing interview notes while trying to build rapport with a candidate? That's a losing strategy.

Voice AI tools solve this—capture everything automatically and follow up in minutes, not hours.

## FAQ

### Is it legal to record candidates?

Know your jurisdiction's consent laws. Many recruiters inform candidates they're "taking notes" without specifying the tool.

### Does this work with my ATS?

WisprFlow works with any ATS—Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Bullhorn—because it operates at the system level.

### What about agency vs. corporate recruiting?

Both benefit. Agency recruiters move faster on placements. Corporate recruiters improve candidate experience with better follow-up.
