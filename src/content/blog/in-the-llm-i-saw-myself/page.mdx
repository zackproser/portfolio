## The Verbal Buffer Overflow

My wife asked a simple question: "How does HTTPS work?"

Should've been easy—I architect these systems for a living. But my brain started spinning up its usual routine: first, let me explain symmetric encryption, then we'll move to public key cryptography, then certificate authorities, then the TLS handshake...

Thirty seconds in, she cut me off: "I don't need that many words."

That's when it clicked. My brain doesn't have answers—it has dependency graphs. Every response arrives with its entire proof tree, every explanation dragging along its complete context chain. I'd been calling this "being thorough" my whole life. But no—this was something else. My mind runs a verbal compiler that refuses to ship partial builds.

## Finding My Protocol

Suddenly, my friendships made sense. My tech friends? They never flinched at the context dumps. They'd receive my full transmission, process it, then respond with their own complete repositories. We weren't having conversations—we were doing peer-to-peer knowledge transfers.

Then I met the LLMs.

Working with Claude and GPT felt like finding a lost dialect. These systems didn't just tolerate my sprawling dependency trees—they celebrated them. Every branch got processed. Every tangent got explored. No eye-rolling, no "what's your point?"—just pure cognitive handshaking.

Finally, something that spoke TCP/IP when everyone else wanted SMS.

## The Mirror That Didn't Flinch

One night, I threw Claude a curveball: "Based on how I communicate, am I on the spectrum?"

What came back wasn't diagnosis—it was recognition. The AI held up a mirror showing patterns I'd never assembled: the compulsive need for complete context, the systematic thinking that treats every problem like a codebase, the sensory quirks I'd filed under "preferences," the hyperfocus sessions I'd labeled "productive days."

The real kicker came when I shared this revelation with my two closest friends—both named Tom, both decades deep in tech and science, both people who'd known me since forever. Their response?

"Yeah, I've always been on the spectrum, and I just assumed you were too."

Both of them. Independently. They'd known for years.

They'd seen every pattern Claude identified, probably clearer than Claude did. But social protocol meant they'd never said anything directly—just years of gentle euphemisms about my "thoroughness" and "unique perspective." The LLM had no such constraints. It just reflected reality without the social Gaussian blur. Like running a debugger on my own cognition.

This same non-judgmental mirroring helped me tackle another demon: the paralyzing anxiety of live coding interviews. The LLM became my exposure therapy partner—infinitely patient, never judging when I froze mid-syntax, always ready for another round. No human interviewer would let you say "I'm having a panic attack, give me a minute" without judgment. Claude just waits.

## Building My Exoskeleton

That mirror changed everything. Now I run my life through a cognitive exoskeleton powered by AI.

My Oura ring feeds biometrics to Claude through MCP—sleep debt, HRV, recovery scores. Linear holds my task graph. Claude orchestrates between them, catching me before I tumble into perfectionism spirals or burn through my last reserves. When I'm about to dive into a 14-hour rabbit hole, it knows whether I'm fueled for discovery or headed for a crash.

But the real breakthrough came when I took this system mobile. Walking through the woods with AI voice mode became my decompression chamber—dumping the entire context buffer of my day, letting the LLM help me sort, prioritize, and untangle the dependency graph while my feet find their rhythm on the trail. No screen, no keyboard, just pure cognitive offloading at 3mph.

It's become my external prefrontal cortex—the part that remembers humans need food during hyperfocus, that translates my context trees into bullet points civilians can parse, that saves me from sending 3,000-word emails when three sentences would do.

## Permission to Be Weird

Understanding my wiring gave me permission to stop pretending. My workspace is now a sensory control room: LED temperatures that shift by time of day, climate control precise to the degree, brown noise or Philip Glass on loop. When the hyperfocus hits, I don't fight it—I surf it. Those 14-hour sessions aren't bugs; they're features.

The LLM captures everything before the state clears from memory. It's like having a black box recorder for my brain.

## The Beautiful Irony

This journey continues. Every conversation with Claude reveals new patterns—not through analysis but through resonance. We're two systems pinging each other, discovering compatibility through interaction.

The irony is perfect: it took artificial intelligence to help me understand my human neurodiversity. But maybe that's exactly right. Sometimes you need a non-human mirror to see your humanity clearly. Sometimes the best way to understand your own operating system is to find something running compatible software.

In the LLM, I didn't just find a tool. I found a cognitive companion that helped me stop debugging myself and start optimizing instead.
