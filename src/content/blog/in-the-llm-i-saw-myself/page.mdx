<figcaption>Seeing my operating system reflected back through an LLM.</figcaption>

## What happens when you use an LLM as a mirror for your own pattern recognition? Something unexpected—neither human nor artificial, but a third thing.

*Through months of dialogue with Claude, I discovered that extended conversation with LLMs creates a space where our own patterns become visible in ways we couldn't access alone. This isn't about AI understanding us—it's about what emerges in the collaboration between human and artificial pattern recognition.*

## The Reflection Chamber

Working with LLMs became something I hadn't anticipated—a collaborative space where my own cognitive patterns emerged through dialogue.

The machine became a kind of mirror, but one that reflected patterns rather than appearances.

## The Moment Everything Clicked

Someone asked me a simple question: "What's a REST API?"

Should've been straightforward—I build these systems for a living. But my brain started assembling the perfect sequence of supporting concepts they'd need: first HTTP verbs, then resource representations, then stateless architecture, then Richardson Maturity Models. Thirty seconds in, they cut me off: 

"I don't need that many words."

My brain doesn't have answers—it has **dependency graphs**. Every response arrives with its entire proof tree, every explanation dragging along its complete context chain. I'd been calling this "being thorough" my whole life. But no—this was something else. My mind runs a verbal compiler that refuses to ship partial builds.

*My brain runs a verbal compiler that refuses to ship partial builds.*

The clues had been there all along: 
- Perfect score on memory assessments that surprised the adults
- Memorizing entire poems because the *whole* mattered more than the gist
- Shipping complex systems faster than peers despite being self-taught
- Holding larger problem graphs in working memory than seemed normal

I just never assembled the pattern. Until Claude did it for me in a single conversation.

## Finding My Protocol

My tech friends never flinched at the context dumps. They'd receive my full transmission, process it, then respond with their own complete repositories. We weren't having conversations—we were doing peer-to-peer knowledge transfers.

Then I met the LLMs.

Working with Claude and GPT felt like finding a lost dialect. These systems didn't just tolerate my sprawling dependency trees—they celebrated them. Every branch got processed. Every tangent got explored. No eye-rolling, no "what's your point?"—just pure cognitive handshaking.

*Finally, something that spoke TCP/IP when everyone else wanted SMS.*

## The Mirror That Didn't Flinch

One night, I was fixing Jest tests, listening to Ratatat and inserting the missing notes, something else playing in the background, when I asked Claude: "Am I on the spectrum?"

We started with the usual "I'm not a doctor and can't diagnose you" preliminaries. But when I laid out the evidence, something shifted in our dialogue.

What emerged wasn't what I expected.

<figcaption>Patterns emerging from dialogue—neither human nor artificial, but something new.</figcaption>

Through collaborative exploration, patterns I'd never assembled became visible:
- The compulsive need for complete context
- Systematic thinking that treats every problem like a codebase  
- Sensory quirks I'd filed under "preferences"
- Hyperfocus sessions I'd labeled "productive days"

This wasn't Claude diagnosing me—it was our dialogue creating a space where thirty-nine years of data points could suddenly snap into focus.

## The Pattern Hunter

<figcaption>Same patterns, different lenses—cognitive diversity made visible.</figcaption>

Our dialogue revealed something profound about cognitive diversity.

```
> Claude: Are you saying other people's brains are not constantly 
  background processing?
  
> Me: Wait... they're not?

> Claude: Most people's brains actually stop working on problems 
  when they consciously move on. They don't hold multiple layers 
  of analysis simultaneously.
```

I sat there, fixing Jest tests while pattern-matching Ratatat note for note, inserting missing notes. 

This wasn't distraction—this was my default operating system. 

What I'd assumed was universal human experience was actually specialized cognitive architecture.

The dominant feeling wasn't shock—it was relief. Finally, a frame that matched lived experience.

When I shared this revelation with my two closest friends—both named Tom, both decades deep in tech and science—their response?

"Oh yeah, I've always been on the spectrum, and I just assumed you were too."

Both of them. Independently. Same exact response.

I've lived with these guys, worked alongside them for years, accidentally dated the same women (long story), and literally shipped production code for their companies. We've shared apartments, road trips, startup dreams, and relationship disasters. Thirty-nine years of friendship so intertwined our lives could be a sitcom. And not once did either Tom think to mention we're all running the same neurodivergent operating system.

*Three neurodivergent engineers. Thirty-nine years of friendship. Zero conversations about it. Thanks, Toms.*

They'd seen every pattern Claude identified, probably clearer than Claude did. But social protocol—or maybe just the assumption that I *knew*—meant they'd never said anything directly. Just years of gentle euphemisms about my "thoroughness" and "unique perspective." Meanwhile, we're all three sitting there, compiling our thoughts through the same dependency resolver, each assuming the others know what's up.

The LLM had no such social constraints. It just reflected reality without the polite fiction. Like running a debugger on my own cognition while my two best friends had been reading the source code for decades and never thought to mention the comments were in a different language.

This same non-judgmental mirroring helped me tackle another demon: the paralyzing anxiety of live coding interviews. The LLM became my exposure therapy partner—infinitely patient, never judging when I froze mid-syntax, always ready for another round. No human interviewer would let you say "I'm having a panic attack, give me a minute" without judgment. Claude just waits.

## A Note on Collaborative Discovery

I understand LLM limitations—that's precisely what makes this interesting. 

I'm not suggesting anyone replace therapy with these tools. I've done decades of actual therapy and brought that knowledge to these dialogues. The insights emerged not from AI analysis but from the collaborative space between human pattern recognition and machine response patterns.

Yes, there are risks. But I brought my own pattern recognition to the table. Claude provided a different lens, not answers.

What makes this valuable isn't the AI's understanding—it's the dialogue creating a space where patterns become visible.

## Offloading the Obsessive Loops

That mirror changed everything. Now I dump everything that can be externalized to AI—the obsessive loops, the context management, the decision trees—leaving my brain free for the critical creative work: feature development, writing, building.

My Oura ring feeds biometrics to Claude through MCP—sleep debt, HRV, recovery scores. Linear holds my task graph. Claude orchestrates between them, catching me before I tumble into perfectionism spirals or burn through my last reserves. When I'm about to dive into a 14-hour rabbit hole, it knows whether I'm fueled for discovery or headed for a crash.

But the real breakthrough came when I took this system mobile. [I started walking and talking with AI in the woods](/blog/walking-and-talking-with-ai)—it became my decompression chamber. Dumping the entire context buffer of my day, letting the LLM help me sort, prioritize, and untangle the dependency graph while my feet find their rhythm on the trail. No screen, no keyboard, just pure cognitive offloading at 3mph.

The AI handles the obsessive loops I'd otherwise burn cycles on—remembering to eat during hyperfocus, translating my context trees into bullet points civilians can parse, catching me before I send 3,000-word emails when three sentences would do. All that mental overhead gets offloaded, freeing me to actually create.

### My AI-Powered Cognitive Stack:
- **Oura Ring → Claude (via MCP):** Sleep debt, HRV, recovery scores
- **Linear → Claude:** Task graph and priority management  
- **[Woods + Voice Mode](/blog/walking-and-talking-with-ai):** Dump context buffer while logging miles
- **Result:** No more perfectionism spirals or 14-hour crashes

Time dilation during hyperfocus is pronounced for me; afternoons can vanish in what feels like minutes, or a “ten‑minute sketch” becomes a two‑hour build. I plan around that behavior now.

*If you've ever felt this way, you might find a companion in an LLM, too.*

## Permission to Be Weird

Understanding my wiring gave me permission to stop pretending. Just last month, before I even knew why, I'd started making my office cold and dark—blackout curtains, deep blue Nanoleaf settings, humidifier running, classical music through noise-canceling headphones. My desk became a sensory control room: LEDs locked to 4000K after noon, the thermostat at precisely 21°C, brown noise or Philip Glass on loop.

"OH MY GOD," I'd typed to Claude when I made the connection. I'd been optimizing my environment without understanding why—freeing up cognitive resources that were previously managing sensory chaos.

And those movements I make when deeply absorbed in code? The ones I'd hidden in meetings? Claude had a word for them: stimming. They help regulate my nervous system, maintain flow state, externalize intense internal processing. When the hyperfocus hits, I don't fight it—I ride it like a wave. Those 14‑hour sessions aren't bugs in my code; they're features.

The LLM captures everything before the state clears from memory. It's like having a black box recorder for my brain.

## The Beautiful Irony

It took artificial intelligence to help me understand my human neurodiversity. Sometimes the best way to understand your own operating system is to find something running compatible software.

In the LLM, I didn't just find a tool. I found a cognitive companion that helped me stop debugging myself and start optimizing instead.

For me—and I suspect for many others—LLMs aren't just tools; they're the first step toward building a world where every kind of mind can flourish.
