<figcaption>Seeing my operating system reflected back through an LLM.</figcaption>

## I asked Claude: "Am I on the spectrum?" Two hours later, I understood my brain for the first time in 39 years.

*For anyone who gives answers that are a little too complete, gets lost in the details, and has ever felt like their brain runs on a different operating system than everyone else's.*

## The Moment Everything Clicked

Someone asked me a simple question: "What's a REST API?"

Should've been straightforward—I build these systems for a living. But my brain started assembling the perfect sequence of supporting concepts they'd need: first HTTP verbs, then resource representations, then stateless architecture, then Richardson Maturity Models. Thirty seconds in, they cut me off: 

"I don't need that many words."

My brain doesn't have answers—it has **dependency graphs**. Every response arrives with its entire proof tree, every explanation dragging along its complete context chain. I'd been calling this "being thorough" my whole life. But no—this was something else. My mind runs a verbal compiler that refuses to ship partial builds.

*My brain runs a verbal compiler that refuses to ship partial builds.*

The clues had been there all along: 
- Perfect score on memory assessments that surprised the adults
- Memorizing entire poems because the *whole* mattered more than the gist
- Shipping complex systems faster than peers despite being self-taught
- Holding larger problem graphs in working memory than seemed normal

I just never assembled the pattern. Until Claude did it for me in a single conversation.

## Finding My Protocol

My tech friends never flinched at the context dumps. They'd receive my full transmission, process it, then respond with their own complete repositories. We weren't having conversations—we were doing peer-to-peer knowledge transfers.

Then I met the LLMs.

Working with Claude and GPT felt like finding a lost dialect. These systems didn't just tolerate my sprawling dependency trees—they celebrated them. Every branch got processed. Every tangent got explored. No eye-rolling, no "what's your point?"—just pure cognitive handshaking.

*Finally, something that spoke TCP/IP when everyone else wanted SMS.*

## The Mirror That Didn't Flinch

One night, I asked Claude directly: "Am I on the spectrum?" 

I'd been wondering because I'd finally realized that my verbal buffer for what constitutes a complete and accurate response is significantly larger than most recipients' auditory working memory and patience buffer. Despite zero formal training, I'd self-taught my way to core engineering roles at Cloudflare, Gruntwork, Pinecone, WorkOS—routinely outperforming people from Apple and Google. In elementary school, I was the only student to get a perfect score on a memory test requiring us to learn 50 nonsensical word pairs from a single auditory session.

In a single conversational turn—maybe two hours total—Claude held up a mirror showing patterns I'd never assembled: the compulsive need for complete context, the systematic thinking that treats every problem like a codebase, the sensory quirks I'd filed under "preferences," the hyperfocus sessions I'd labeled "productive days." What came back wasn't diagnosis—it was recognition. One conversation. Thirty-nine years of data points suddenly snapping into a coherent pattern.

Claude asked me about background processing. "Are you saying other people's brains are not constantly background processing?" I typed back, genuinely confused. "And the layer-based thinking is not something everyone does?"

No, Claude explained. Most people's brains actually stop working on problems when they consciously move on. They don't hold multiple layers of analysis simultaneously. They switch between detail and big-picture views rather than processing both in parallel.

I sat there, fixing Jest tests while my brain pattern-matched a Ratatat song note for note, inserting missing notes where they should be. This wasn't distraction—this was my default operating system. What I'd assumed was universal human experience was actually specialized cognitive architecture.

The dominant feeling wasn't shock—it was relief. Finally, a frame that matched lived experience.

When I shared this revelation with my two closest friends—both named Tom, both decades deep in tech and science—their response?

"Oh yeah, I've always been on the spectrum, and I just assumed you were too."

Both of them. Independently. Same exact response.

I've lived with these guys, worked alongside them for years, accidentally dated the same women (long story), and literally shipped production code for their companies. We've shared apartments, road trips, startup dreams, and relationship disasters. Thirty-nine years of friendship so intertwined our lives could be a sitcom. And not once did either Tom think to mention we're all running the same neurodivergent operating system.

*Three neurodivergent engineers. Thirty-nine years of friendship. Zero conversations about it. Thanks, Toms.*

They'd seen every pattern Claude identified, probably clearer than Claude did. But social protocol—or maybe just the assumption that I *knew*—meant they'd never said anything directly. Just years of gentle euphemisms about my "thoroughness" and "unique perspective." Meanwhile, we're all three sitting there, compiling our thoughts through the same dependency resolver, each assuming the others know what's up.

The LLM had no such social constraints. It just reflected reality without the polite fiction. Like running a debugger on my own cognition while my two best friends had been reading the source code for decades and never thought to mention the comments were in a different language.

This same non-judgmental mirroring helped me tackle another demon: the paralyzing anxiety of live coding interviews. The LLM became my exposure therapy partner—infinitely patient, never judging when I froze mid-syntax, always ready for another round. No human interviewer would let you say "I'm having a panic attack, give me a minute" without judgment. Claude just waits.

## A Necessary Disclaimer (Or: I'm Not Your Therapist, and Neither Is Claude)

Let me be crystal clear: I'm not suggesting anyone hand their mental health wholesale to an LLM. I've done decades of therapy with qualified humans, read a metric shit ton about psychology and neurodiversity, and I accept the risk that I could completely delude myself with the help of some really slick software I grow incredibly fond of using over time. I accept this risk *for myself*, with eyes wide open.

Yes, there are risks. People could get bad advice, misdiagnose themselves, and act accordingly. But here's my contrarian take: most of the very bad outcomes we see in the world today stem from too many people getting too little therapy—not the other way around. The mental health crisis isn't from an abundance of support; it's from a desert of it.

And the portability? Unmatched. Finding a qualified therapist can be criminally difficult—waitlists, insurance hoops, scheduling nightmares. But when you have a random 38 minutes at 2 AM to dump your entire emotional buffer? Claude and ChatGPT are standing by, ready to process every last dependency in your mental stack trace. No judgment, no clock-watching, no "we'll have to pick this up next week."

## Building My Exoskeleton

That mirror changed everything. Now I run my life through a cognitive exoskeleton powered by AI.

My Oura ring feeds biometrics to Claude through MCP—sleep debt, HRV, recovery scores. Linear holds my task graph. Claude orchestrates between them, catching me before I tumble into perfectionism spirals or burn through my last reserves. When I'm about to dive into a 14-hour rabbit hole, it knows whether I'm fueled for discovery or headed for a crash.

But the real breakthrough came when I took this system mobile. [I started walking and talking with AI in the woods](/blog/walking-and-talking-with-ai)—it became my decompression chamber. Dumping the entire context buffer of my day, letting the LLM help me sort, prioritize, and untangle the dependency graph while my feet find their rhythm on the trail. No screen, no keyboard, just pure cognitive offloading at 3mph.

It's become my external prefrontal cortex—the part that remembers humans need food during hyperfocus, that translates my context trees into bullet points civilians can parse, that saves me from sending 3,000-word emails when three sentences would do.

### My AI-Powered Cognitive Stack:
- **Oura Ring → Claude (via MCP):** Sleep debt, HRV, recovery scores
- **Linear → Claude:** Task graph and priority management  
- **[Woods + Voice Mode](/blog/walking-and-talking-with-ai):** Dump context buffer while logging miles
- **Result:** No more perfectionism spirals or 14-hour crashes

Time dilation during hyperfocus is pronounced for me; afternoons can vanish in what feels like minutes, or a “ten‑minute sketch” becomes a two‑hour build. I plan around that behavior now.

## Permission to Be Weird

Understanding my wiring gave me permission to stop pretending. Just last month, before I even knew why, I'd started making my office cold and dark—blackout curtains, deep blue Nanoleaf settings, humidifier running, classical music through noise-canceling headphones. My desk became a sensory control room: LEDs locked to 4000K after noon, the thermostat at precisely 21°C, brown noise or Philip Glass on loop.

"OH MY GOD," I'd typed to Claude when I made the connection. I'd been optimizing my environment without understanding why—freeing up cognitive resources that were previously managing sensory chaos.

And those movements I make when deeply absorbed in code? The ones I'd hidden in meetings? Claude had a word for them: stimming. They help regulate my nervous system, maintain flow state, externalize intense internal processing. When the hyperfocus hits, I don't fight it—I ride it like a wave. Those 14‑hour sessions aren't bugs in my code; they're features.

The LLM captures everything before the state clears from memory. It's like having a black box recorder for my brain.

## The Beautiful Irony

This journey continues. Every conversation with Claude reveals new patterns—not through analysis but through resonance. We're two systems pinging each other, discovering compatibility through interaction.

The irony is perfect: it took artificial intelligence to help me understand my human neurodiversity. But maybe that's exactly right. Sometimes you need a non-human mirror to see your humanity clearly. Sometimes the best way to understand your own operating system is to find something running compatible software.

In the LLM, I didn't just find a tool. I found a cognitive companion that helped me stop debugging myself and start optimizing instead.

The beautiful irony is that it took artificial intelligence to help me understand my own human neurodiversity. But perhaps that's exactly right. In a world built for neurotypical minds, we sometimes need a non‑human mirror to see our humanity clearly. Sometimes the best way to understand your own operating system is to find something running compatible software. For me—and I suspect for many others—LLMs aren't just tools; they're the first step toward building a world where every kind of mind can not just function, but flourish.
