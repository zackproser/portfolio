## How do I write so fast?

Occasionally someone will ask me how I am able to write new content so quickly. This is my answer.

There are two reasons I'm able to write quickly:

## 1. I write in my head 

I mostly write new articles in my head while I'm walking around doing other things. This means that by the time I am back at a computer, I usually just need to type in what I've already hashed out.

## 2. I automate and improve my process constantly

The fact that I'm constantly writing in my own head means that my real job is rapid, frictionless capture. 

When I have an idea that I want to develop into a full post, I will capture it in one of two ways: 

1. I'll use Obsidian, my second brain, and add a new note to my `Writing > In progress` folder 

1. I'll use my own tool, Panthalia, ([intro](https://zackproser.com/videos/panthalia-intro) and [update](https://zackproser.com/videos/panthalia-speech-to-text)), which allows me to go from idea fragment to open pull request in seconds

I've found there's a significant motivational benefit to ***only needing to finish an open pull request*** versus writing an entire article from scratch. 

Going from post fragment (or, the kernel of the idea) to open pull request reduces the perceived lift of the task.
