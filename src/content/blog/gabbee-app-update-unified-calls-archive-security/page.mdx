We just shipped a big UX upgrade to <Link href="https://gabbee.io">Gabbee</Link>. It’s now faster to add tasks, easier to manage calls, clearer to review outcomes, and more secure by default.

## What’s new

- **Faster Task Composer**
  - Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit instantly from anywhere in the app
  - Input clears immediately for rapid consecutive entries
  - Phone and voice selectors are inline to reduce extra clicks

- **Unified Calls + Archive**
  - One searchable list for active and archived calls
  - Archive from the call detail and restore anytime
  - Clear, color‑coded status badges at a glance

- **Cleaner Review Panel**
  - Plan steps, live statuses, and results in one place
  - Summaries and transcripts wrap cleanly—no sideways scrolling

- **Automatic Call Titles**
  - Concise titles are generated after you create or schedule a call
  - Keeps your call list tidy and scannable

- **Privacy and Security**
  - All task endpoints and detail pages verify ownership against the signed‑in user
  - Safer by default; your data stays yours

- **Readability Improvements**
  - Long content wraps correctly and preserves line breaks
  - Better at-a-glance readability across the app

## Why it matters

- **Less friction**: Compose and submit faster without context switching.
- **More clarity**: See call status and results without digging.
- **More trust**: Stronger safeguards protect your account and data.
