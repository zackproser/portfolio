## FAQ

### What about recording consent?

Know your jurisdiction's laws. One-party vs. two-party consent varies. Journalistic practices around recording vary by outlet.

### Is the transcript accurate enough to quote from?

For pulling quotes, yes. Always verify critical quotes by listening to the audio for exact wording.

### Does this work for investigative work?

These tools capture what you hear. Security considerations for sensitive investigations are beyond typical use cases.
