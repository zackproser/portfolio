<figcaption>Voice AI tools help executives focus on leadership instead of admin</figcaption>

Executives spend their days in meetings, making decisions, and communicating strategy. What they shouldn't be doing: typing meeting notes, drafting routine emails, and documenting everything manually.

Voice AI tools handle the administrative overhead so you can focus on leading.

<AffiliateLink product="granola" campaign={campaign}>Granola</AffiliateLink> captures your meetings invisibly—board meetings, 1:1s, strategy sessions—without anyone knowing you're recording.

### Why Executives Need This

**Be fully present**: Back-to-back meetings require full attention. Granola captures everything while you focus on the discussion.

**Never miss commitments**: "I'll get back to you on that" becomes trackable. Action items extracted automatically.

**No visible recording**: Board members and investors don't see a bot. Sensitive discussions stay natural.

### Executive Use Cases

- **Board meetings**: Complete record of decisions and discussions
- **Direct report 1:1s**: Track coaching conversations and commitments
- **Strategy sessions**: Capture brainstorming without killing the flow
- **External meetings**: Investor calls, customer meetings, partner discussions

</AffiliateLink>

<AffiliateLink product="wisprflow" campaign={campaign}>WisprFlow</AffiliateLink> lets you dictate emails, memos, and strategic documents at speaking speed—3x faster than typing.

### High-Volume Communication

**Emails at scale**: Executives send 50-100+ emails daily. Dictation cuts response time dramatically.

**Strategic memos**: Speak your vision and strategy. Edit on screen.

**Board communications**: Formal updates dictated professionally.

### Executive Advantage

Most executives think faster than they type. Voice closes that gap—capture your thinking at the speed it occurs.

## FAQ

### Is this appropriate for sensitive board discussions?

Granola runs locally and uses enterprise-grade encryption. Evaluate their security documentation for your specific governance requirements.

### Will my EA still be useful?

More useful. They can focus on judgment-required tasks instead of transcription and routine drafting.

### Does this work on mobile?

Granola has iOS for in-person meetings. WisprFlow is Mac-only currently—pair with a laptop for mobile dictation.
