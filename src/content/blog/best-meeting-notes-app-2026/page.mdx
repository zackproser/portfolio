## Comparison Table

| Feature | Granola | Otter | Fireflies | Teams Copilot |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| No visible bot | Yes | No | No | N/A |

## Why "No Bot" Matters

When a bot joins your meeting:
1. "Otter Bot has joined"
2. Participants notice
3. Someone asks "Are you recording this?"
4. The conversation becomes guarded

This is especially problematic for:
- Client calls
- Sales conversations
- Sensitive internal discussions
- External partnerships

Granola avoids this entirely. Participants see just you on the call.

## My Workflow

1. **Calendar synced**: Granola detects meetings automatically
2. **Join meeting normally**: No bot, no announcement
3. **Focus on the conversation**: Not on note-taking
4. **After meeting**: Review transcript, action items already extracted
5. **Share if needed**: Export to teammates

## FAQ

### Is Granola recording other participants without consent?

You're responsible for consent laws in your jurisdiction. Many users inform participants they're "taking notes" without specifying the tool.

### Does Granola work offline?

It needs internet for AI processing. The audio is captured locally, then processed in the cloud.

### What about Zoom's built-in transcription?

Zoom's transcription is okay but visible to all participants and lacks the AI summarization and action item extraction.

### Can I use multiple meeting apps?

Yes. Granola captures whatever audio your device plays—Zoom, Teams, Meet, phone calls, etc.
