|---|---|
| My program compiles after an onerous redactoring|  elation|   
| People add meetings to my calendar to talk through deliverables they haven't thought through or locked down yet| like my precious focus time is being wasted   |   
| Another developer says something I created was helpful to them| like a link in a long chain stretching from the past into the future|  
| Someone downloads my code, tool or package| absolutely victorious |
| I ship something important | A mixture of satisfaction, hope and dread that I've missed something critical|
| My pull request is merged | absolutely victorious |
