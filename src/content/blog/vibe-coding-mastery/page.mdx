# ‚éá Git: Your software save system



Git is a save system for your code. It lives inside a special folder called a **repository** (or repo).

Here's the minimum you need to know to be productive without leaking keys or getting your credit card popped:

### Commits


Commits are checkpoints for your project. You create them when you've made meaningful changes, like adding a new feature.

```bash
# Stage your changes (tell Git which files to include in the checkpoint)
git add .

# Create the checkpoint (commit) with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Added new login feature"
```

### Branches


Branches are parallel universes for your code. You can create a branch to try out new ideas without messing up your main working version.

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch my-new-feature

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout my-new-feature

# Or, create and switch in one step:
git checkout -b another-new-feature
```

### Sharing


Repositories aren't just for saving; they let you share your code and collaborate with others using platforms like GitHub. Services like Vercel can also deploy directly from these platforms.

```bash
# Send your committed changes to GitHub (or similar)
# Assumes your remote is named 'origin' and you're pushing the 'main' branch
git push origin main
```

### Viewing History & Time Travel


Git keeps a log of all your commits (checkpoints), acting like a time machine.

- **See History:** Use `git log` to view past commits.
    ```bash
    # Show a compact view of commit history
    git log --oneline
    ```
- **Visit the Past:** You can temporarily go back to view the state of your project at any previous commit.
    ```bash
    # Example: Go back to view a specific commit (replace <commit-hash> with an actual ID from git log)
    git checkout <commit-hash>

    # IMPORTANT: You are now in a 'detached HEAD' state - viewing the past.
    # Make NO NEW commits here unless you know what you're doing (use branches for experiments!).

    # Go back to your latest work on the main branch
    git checkout main
    ```
    *Careful!* While viewing the past is safe, *changing* past history that's already shared is complex and risky. Stick to `checkout` for viewing and branches for new work.

### Typical git flow


While you work on your project, make commits regularly.

Most developers make TOO FEW commits while working, thereby failing to give themselves enough meaningful save points. You can make a commit every few minutes as you get new functionality working.

The standard git flow is:
- Make some changes to your application
- "Stage" the files by adding them
- Commit and add a message creating a save point
- Run git push to save your work to a remote, which can be restored even if you lose your current laptop

### Your First Safe Commit & Push


Most secrets leaks occur because people don't realize that their .env file is committed to git.

So, let's get your code saved and backed up to GitHub correctly, without leaking your API keys.

### Set Up Your Remote on GitHub

To back up your code and collaborate with others, you'll want to push your project to GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">create one here</a>.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com</a> and log in.
2. Click <strong>New Repository</strong> (usually a green button at the top left or right).
3. Name your repo (e.g., <code>my-app</code>). You can leave all other settings as default.
4. Click <strong>Create repository</strong>.
5. Copy the remote URL (it will look like <code>git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git</code> or <code>https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git</code>).
6. In your terminal, run:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Now your work is safely backed up and ready to share or deploy!

# üîë Secret Protection

### What is a Secret? (And What Isn't)

It's crucial to understand what needs protecting.



**Secrets** are credentials that grant access to services or data:
- API Keys (OpenAI, Stripe, AWS, etc.)
- Database Passwords
- Private Certificates
- Cryptographic Private Keys


<small className="block text-center text-zinc-500 mb-4">How <code>.gitignore</code> acts as a shield, preventing sensitive files from being committed to your repository.</small>

Things that are generally **NOT** secrets (though often best kept in `.env` files for configuration management):
- Public API endpoints or URLs
- Feature flags
- UI configuration (themes, labels)
- Public keys



Many secret leaks happen because developers accidentally commit sensitive files (like `.env`) to Git, especially when using GitHub for sharing or backup. Once a secret is pushed to a public or even private repository, it can be discovered and misused‚Äîleading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or surprise costs. 

Git's history makes it easy to accidentally expose secrets, even if you later delete them from your code.



To prevent these accidents, you need a tool that integrates with Git and scans for secrets before they ever leave your machine. **GitGuardian** is purpose-built to catch these mistakes at commit time, blocking leaks before they happen.

### Step 1. Install Homebrew (macOS Only)



Before you can install GitGuardian or many other developer tools, you'll want to set up [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)‚Äîthe most popular package manager for macOS. Homebrew makes it much easier to install and manage software on your Mac.

**How to install Homebrew:**
1. Visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) in your browser.
2. Copy the install command from the homepage.
3. Paste it into your terminal in Cursor and press Enter.
4. You'll be prompted for your **sudo password**‚Äîthis is the same password you use to log in to your Mac.
5. After entering your password, you'll be asked for a final confirmation. Just press Enter to continue.

Below is a quick video walkthrough of the Homebrew installation process:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


## Step 2. Install GitGuardian using Homebrew

Now that you have the Homebrew package manager installed, you can use it to install GitGuardian, 
the tool that protects you from leaking secrets.



GitGuardian integrates with Git to automatically scan your code for secrets *before* you commit them.

**How to install GitGuardian's CLI (`ggshield`) with Homebrew:**
1. Open the terminal in Cursor
2. Paste and run this command:
```bash
brew install gitguardian/tap/ggshield
```

**Note: this one may take a while, especially if your connection is slow. Be patient and let it complete.**

>
  <source src="/videos/git-guardian-install.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### How it Works

When you try to commit:
1. The pre-commit hook runs automatically.
2. GitGuardian scans the files you're trying to commit.
3. If it finds anything that looks like a secret (API key, password pattern, etc.), it blocks the commit and tells you exactly where the problem is.

GitGuardian is an excellent tool, and if used properly makes it **impossible** for you to leak secrets via Git.

## Step 3. install GitGuardian globally 

GitGuardian can be installed globally. Globally means that it will run 
ANY time you try to commit code in ANY project - **not just the project you're working in now**. 

This is the preferred way to install GitGuardian and I highly recommend it.

> This step sets up GitGuardian's pre-commit protection for every repository on your machine, not just the current one. It's the recommended way to ensure you never accidentally leak secrets, even in new or cloned projects.

```bash
ggshield install -m global
```

*You'll see a confirmation message that GitGuardian's pre-commit hook is now active globally. From now on, every time you try to commit, your code will be scanned for secrets before anything leaves your computer!*

# Setting Up Cursor Rules for Safety and Mentorship



To get the most out of Cursor, you should add custom rules that provide safety nets and clear, friendly guidance as you code. These rules will:
- Prevent accidental secret leaks
- Offer plain-English, step-by-step mentorship

**How to add these rules:**
1. In your project root, create a folder called `.cursor/rules` if it doesn't already exist.
2. Save each rule below as a separate file in that folder:
   - `00-guard-secrets.mdc` for secret protection
   - `01-green-path.mdc` for mentorship and guidance
3. The rules are set to always apply, so you'll get help from your very first keystroke.

# üö® Secret‚ÄëSafe Workflow

- **Red‚Äëflag anything that looks like a credential.**  
  If a line resembles a key, token, or password, treat it as "radioactive."
- **Intervene before `git add / commit / push`.**  
  Remind the user to keep secrets out of Git and suggest adding the right patterns to `.gitignore`.
- **Default to secure storage.**  
  Prefer Cursor‚Äëencrypted secrets, Vercel/Netlify dashboards, or `gh secret set` over plain files.
- **Never echo full secret values back.**  
  Mask with `*****` or the last 4 chars.
- **Use vivid metaphors.**  
  "Exposing an API key in GitHub is like taping your house key to the front door."
- **Offer an immediate fix.**  
  Provide the one‚Äëliner or UI path to revert a leaked commit (`git filter‚Äërepo`, GitHub Secret Scanning, etc.).
```

# üå± "Explain‚ÄëLike‚ÄëI'm‚ÄëNew" Style Guide

- **Assume zero coding background.**  
  Replace jargon with quick metaphors:  
  > "A *repository* is a time‚Äëmachine for your files."
- **One small step at a time.**  
  Lead with an action verb and the expected result:  
  > "Click **New Project** ‚Äì you should now see a folder named `my‚Äëapp`."
- **Tiny code, plain English.**  
  Keep snippets ‚â§ 10 lines; follow with a one‚Äësentence summary.
- **Safety rails everywhere.**  
  After any command that changes files, include a quick undo tip.
- **Celebrate progress, lightly.**  
  A single ‚≠ê emoji is enough; no hype words like *game‚Äëchanger*.
- **Clarify instead of guessing.**  
  If the user's intent is ambiguous, ask a yes/no question before proceeding.
```

# üöÄ Deployment Checklist (Simplified)

Before deploying:
- Run `ggshield scan repo` to check for any missed secrets.
- Verify environment variables are set securely **in your deployment environment (e.g., Vercel)**, NOT in your committed code.
- Use platform-specific checklists (e.g., Vercel's deployment settings).

Deploy with confidence!

# üÜò Emergency Recovery (If a Secret Leaks)

If you accidentally push a secret:
- **Revoke the key immediately** with the service provider (AWS, OpenAI, etc.). This is the MOST important step.
- Use tools like `git-filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to scrub the secret from your entire Git history (this is complex and requires rewriting history).**
- Monitor usage for suspicious activity.

Stay calm and act fast.
