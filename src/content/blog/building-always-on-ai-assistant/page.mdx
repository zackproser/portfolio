I have an AI assistant that never sleeps. It runs on a tiny computer under my desk, accessible from my phone, laptop, or a voice call from anywhere in the world.

It reads my email, manages my calendar, tracks my health data, monitors my projects, and can even call me when something needs attention.

This is how I built it.

## The problem

Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants are stateless. Every conversation starts fresh. They can't check your email while you're asleep. They can't remind you about that meeting you forgot. They can't notice that your calendar is packed after a night of terrible sleep.

I wanted something different: an AI assistant that's **always on**, has **persistent memory**, and can **reach me** through multiple channels.

## The hardware: System76 Meerkat

The [System76 Meerkat](https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat) is a tiny, silent, Linux-first mini PC. Mine has:

- Intel Core i5
- 32GB RAM
- 500GB NVMe SSD
- Ubuntu 24.04

Total power draw: about 15 watts. It sits under my desk, always on, runs my entire AI infrastructure.

Why not a cloud VM? Three reasons:

1. **Latency** — Local is faster for anything touching my network
2. **Cost** — $600 once vs $50/month forever
3. **Control** — My data, my machine, my rules

## The software: OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source AI gateway that turns Claude into an operational assistant. It provides:

- **Persistent sessions** — Memory across conversations
- **Multi-channel access** — Discord, Telegram, Slack, SMS, voice
- **Tool integrations** — Email, calendar, browser, shell access
- **Scheduled tasks** — Cron jobs, reminders, heartbeat checks
- **Voice calls** — Twilio integration for phone conversations

The gateway runs as a systemd service, survives reboots, and keeps my assistant available 24/7.

```bash
# Install OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw

# Configure and start
openclaw configure
openclaw gateway start

# Enable on boot
openclaw gateway service install
```

## The network: Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) creates a private mesh network between all my devices. The Meerkat, my MacBook, my phone — all connected, all secure, no port forwarding needed.

Key features I use:

- **Tailscale Funnel** — Exposes specific ports to the internet (for Twilio webhooks)
- **Magic DNS** — Access the Meerkat as `meerkat.tailnet` from any device
- **SSH** — Secure shell access from anywhere

```bash
# Expose voice webhook to internet
tailscale funnel 3334

# Now https://meerkat.tailb6b796.ts.net routes to localhost:3334
```

This is how Twilio can call my local machine for voice webhooks without exposing anything else.

## The integrations

Here's everything I connected and why:

### Communication

| Integration | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Discord** | Primary chat interface — always open, desktop + mobile |
| **Gmail** | Read, search, draft, and send email as me |
| **Google Calendar** | Check availability, create events, send invites |
| **Slack** | Monitor work channels, respond to mentions |
| **Twilio Voice** | Inbound/outbound phone calls with speech |

### Productivity

| Integration | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **GitHub** | PR reviews, issue management, repo operations |
| **Linear** | Task tracking, project status |
| **Notion** | Notes, documents, knowledge base |
| **Browser** | Web automation, research, form filling |

### Health & Context

| Integration | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Oura Ring** | Sleep quality, readiness scores, HRV data |

### Why these matter

The integrations aren't just "nice to have" — they compound:

- **Oura + Calendar** → "Your readiness is 45. You have 6 meetings. Want me to reschedule the non-critical ones?"
- **Email + Linear** → "Got an email from the Xata team about the article. Created a task in Linear."
- **Voice + Everything** → "Hey Claw, what's on my calendar today?" (while driving)

## Voice calls: The killer feature

This is the part that feels like science fiction.

I saved my Twilio number (+1-510-296-7947) as a contact named "Claw". Now I can:

1. **"Hey Siri, call Claw"**
2. Have a natural conversation
3. Claw transcribes, understands, and acts

The setup:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "voice-call": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "provider": "twilio",
          "fromNumber": "+15102967947",
          "publicUrl": "https://meerkat.tailb6b796.ts.net/voice/webhook",
          "inboundPolicy": "allowlist",
          "allowFrom": ["+18035551234"],
          "inboundGreeting": "Hey Zack, what's up?",
          "streaming": {
            "enabled": true
          },
          "tts": {
            "provider": "elevenlabs",
            "elevenlabs": {
              "voiceId": "pMsXgVXv3BLzUgSXRplE"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This uses:
- **Twilio** for telephony
- **OpenAI Realtime API** for speech-to-text
- **ElevenLabs** for natural-sounding text-to-speech
- **Tailscale Funnel** to receive webhooks

## The side channel: SSH + Claude Code

Here's a workflow most people don't think about:

My MacBook runs Claude Code sessions that need to persist even when my laptop sleeps. Solution: run them on the Meerkat over SSH.

```bash
# From MacBook
ssh meerkat

# Start a tmux session
tmux new -s claude-dev

# Run Claude Code
cd ~/projects/my-app
claude

# Detach with Ctrl-B D
# Laptop can sleep, session continues
```

When I wake up, the Claude Code session has been working. I can check in from my phone via Tailscale SSH if I'm away from my desk.

## Memory and context

OpenClaw maintains workspace files that persist across sessions:

- **MEMORY.md** — Long-term curated knowledge
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — Daily notes and events
- **USER.md** — Information about me (preferences, contacts, context)
- **SOUL.md** — The assistant's personality and guidelines

When a new session starts, Claw reads these files and has full context. No "let me start over" — it remembers the project we were working on, the email we discussed, the reminder we set.

## Heartbeats and proactive behavior

Every 30 minutes, Claw gets a "heartbeat" — a chance to check on things proactively:

- New important emails?
- Calendar events coming up?
- Health data concerning?
- Background tasks completed?
- **Linear tasks tagged for attention?**

If something needs attention, it pings me on Discord. If not, it stays quiet.

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md
- Check for urgent emails from [list of VIPs]
- Remind about any meetings in next 2 hours
- If readiness < 50, suggest lighter schedule
- Check Linear for tasks tagged "claude"
```

## The Linear workflow: Async task delegation

This is where it gets powerful. My goal is to **place work in Linear, tag it, and have Claw proactively pick it up**.

Here's how it works:

1. **I create a task in Linear** — "Research competitors for X feature"
2. **I tag it with `claude`** — This signals it's delegated to my assistant
3. **On the next heartbeat, Claw sees the tagged task**
4. **Claw works on it autonomously** — Research, drafts, analysis
5. **Claw updates the task with results** — Or pings me if blocked

The magic: I don't have to context-switch to delegate. I just drop tasks into Linear during my normal workflow, tag them, and forget about them. Claw wakes up every 30 minutes, checks for new work, and handles it.

```bash
# Example heartbeat check
curl -s -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "{ issues(filter: { labels: { name: { eq: \"claude\" } }, state: { type: { nin: [\"completed\", \"canceled\"] } } }) { nodes { identifier title description } } }"}'
```

This inverts the traditional assistant model. Instead of me stopping to tell Claw what to do, I just tag work and keep moving. Claw catches up on its own schedule.

**Tasks I delegate this way:**
- Research and summarization
- Draft writing (emails, docs, PRs)
- Code review prep
- Meeting context gathering
- Data analysis

**Tasks I don't delegate:**
- Anything requiring real-time interaction
- Decisions that need my judgment
- Sensitive communications

The key insight: **async delegation scales better than synchronous conversation.** I can tag 10 tasks in 2 minutes. Claw works through them over hours while I do deep work.

## Security considerations

This setup has significant access to my digital life. Security measures:

1. **Allowlists** — Only specific Discord servers/channels can interact
2. **Tailscale** — All network traffic is encrypted, no public exposure
3. **Separate user** — OpenClaw runs as non-root user
4. **Audit logs** — All actions are logged
5. **Phone allowlist** — Only my number can call in

The Meerkat itself sits on my home network, behind my router, with Tailscale as the only ingress.

## Why this matters

I'm autistic with ADHD. Executive function is a constant struggle. This system compensates for that:

- **Memory issues?** Claw remembers everything.
- **Time blindness?** Claw tracks the calendar and alerts me.
- **Overwhelmed by email?** Claw filters and summarizes.
- **Can't context-switch?** Claw handles interruptions while I focus.

It's not replacing my brain — it's extending it. An external process that handles the operational drag so I can focus on actual work.

## The cost

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| System76 Meerkat | $600 (one-time) |
| Anthropic API | ~$50-100/month |
| Twilio | ~$5/month |
| ElevenLabs | $5/month |
| Tailscale | Free (personal) |
| OpenClaw | Free (open source) |

About $60-110/month ongoing, less than many SaaS tools, for a system that handles a significant chunk of my operational overhead.

## Getting started

If you want to build something similar:

1. **Get hardware** — Any Linux box works (Raspberry Pi 5 is minimum viable)
2. **Install Tailscale** — [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
3. **Install OpenClaw** — `npm install -g openclaw`
4. **Configure basics** — API keys, Discord channel
5. **Add integrations** — One at a time, as you need them

Start small. Discord + Calendar is a great first milestone. Add voice later when you understand the system.

## What's next

I'm still building. Planned additions:

- **Proactive health alerts** — "Your HRV dropped 20%. Take it easy today."
- **Email drafts for approval** — Draft responses I can approve/edit via Discord
- **Meeting prep** — Auto-pull context before calendar events
- **Travel mode** — Adjust behavior when I'm flying or in different timezones

The foundation is solid. Now it's about making the assistant smarter, more proactive, and more useful.
