In this video, I do a deep dive on the two Jupyter notebooks which I built as part of my office oracle project. 

Both notebooks are now open source: 

* <Link href={"https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle-db-test-notebook"}>Open-sourced Office Oracle Test Notebook</Link>
* <Link href={"https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle-data-bench"}>Open-sourced Office Oracle Data Bench</Link>

I talk through what I learned, why Jupyter notebooks were such a handy tool for getting my data quality to where I needed it to be, before worrying about application logic. 

I also demonstrate langchain DocumentLoaders, how to store secrets in Jupyter notebooks when open sourcing them, and much more.

What's involved in building an AI chatbot that is trained on a custom corpus of knowledge? In this video I breakdown the data preparation, training and app development components and explain why Jupyter notebooks were such a handy tool while creating this app and tweaking my model.

App is open source at https://github.com/zackproser/office-... and a demo is currently available at https://office-oracle.vercel.app.
