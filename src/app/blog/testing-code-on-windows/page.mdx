    description: "As a developer, I often want to test my code on Windows, but don&apos;t have a Windows box handy. This tutorial demonstrates how to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to make provisioning Windows test instances easier. In this post, I also provide a working Packer template and Terraform configuration to deploy your own Windows test instance, as well as instructions for mounting a local folder over RDP.",
