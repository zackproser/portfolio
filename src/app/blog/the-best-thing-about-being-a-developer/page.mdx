## Building your own tools 

Being able to build my own tools is one of the things I most appreciate about being a software developer.

## it's good practice 

You're still building software and picking up new experiences when you work on pet projects 

You quicky pick up on what UX sucks - having a janky

## it's fun

## it's a singular feeling 

to one day realize that the tool you've been hacking on for a while has finally turned a corner and is able to solve the original use case you set out to solve. 

## it can be lucrative 

some developers polish relentlessly until their project starts getting real adoption and becomes a real revenue stream for them
