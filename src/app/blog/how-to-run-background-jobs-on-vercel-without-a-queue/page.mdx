##The Setup 

My open-source app, Panthalia, empowers me to author media rich blog posts in a streamlined fashion even while traveling and away from my keyboard 

## The problem 

I need to clone and perform updates to my portfolio Next.js website from Panthalia. 

This means performing long running git operations and image generation routines in my Vercel functions 

## The solution 

Create functions that you fire and forget from your main API route which accepts jobs. 

These functions call separate API routes to perform long running tasks even after the initial API response has been returned to the client.
