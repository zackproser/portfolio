Codeium began its life as an AI developer tool that offered code-completion for software developers, and 
ChatGPT was originally a general purpose AI language model that could assist with a variety of tasks. 

But as I write this post on February 2nd, 2024, some of these two products' unique capabilities are beginning to 
overlap. What are the key differences and what do you need to know in order to get the most out of them both? 

When you're finished reading this post you'll understand why these tools are so powerful, which capabilities remain unique to each, 
and how you can use them to level up your development or technical workflow.

## How developers use Codeium

Codeium is installed in developer's integrated development environments (IDEs) such as VSCode or Neovim, and 
as they write code, documentation and fix bugs, Codeium is aware of the context of the files being edited and can suggest autocompletions that developers can either accept, 
reject or cycle through. 

As I initially wrote in my [Codeium review in 2023](/blog/codeium-review), I've found Codeium's overall quality of suggestions to be higher than GitHub's Copilot. Codeium is one 
of my favorite tools and I have it installed on all of my development machines because: 
 
* It's free for individual developers
* It works across every possible file type I edit, from YAML to Go, JavaScript, Dockerfiles, shell scripts, etc
* Its suggestions are of superlative quality, across the various auto-completion tools I've tried

ChatGPT is OpenAI's groundbreaking model that is available via a browser interface and API, and a slew of 
developer command line tools and helpers that wrap and call the API. 

The overall capabilities list is beginning to blend together a bit, because Codeium now has free chat functionality - and from some initial testing, it does quite well with the kinds of 
coding asisstant tasks I would normally delegate to ChatGPT:

## Should you use Codeium or ChatGPT?

Honestly, why not both? As I wrote in [Codeium and ChatGPT are all I need](/blog/chatgpt-4-and-codeium-are-my-favorite-stack), these two tools are incredibly powerful on their own, 
and they're even more powerful when combined.

I expect that over time we'll begin to see more comprehensive suites of AI tools and assistants that share context, 
private knowledge bases and are explicitly aware of one another. 

Until then, I'm getting great effect by combining my favorite tools in my daily workflow.

## How do I use Codeium and ChatGPT together? 

As I write this blog post on my Linux laptop in Neovim, I first tab over to Firefox to ask ChatGPT to generate me a hero image I can use in this blog post. I do this in the chat.openai.com 
web interface, because that interface is tightly integrated with DALLE, OpenAI's image generating model. 

<Image src={chatGPTDALLE} alt="ChatGPT's still has the upper hand in image generation" />

I'll let it do a first few iterations, giving notes as we go, and as I write, until we 
get the right image dialed in. 

Meanwhile, as I write out this blog post in Neovim, Codeium is constantly suggesting completions, which is generally less useful when I'm writing prose, but very useful whenever I'm coding, writing 
documentation, writing scripts, etc.
