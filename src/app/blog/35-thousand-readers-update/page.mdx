One year ago, I published [Run your own tech blog](/blog/run-your-own-tech-blog). 

Since then:
 * ~35,000 people have read my work or used my tools
 * 132% growth in traffic
 * My writing directly influenced my career, helping me land roles at Pinecone and WorkOS

Here's how I got thereâ€”and how you can, too. ðŸ‘‡

## 1. I prioritized site speed and health

Slow pages = lower search rankings.

<Image src={pagespeed} alt="Pagespeed" />

Using Vercel, I kept my site fast, hitting a perfect PageSpeed score (screenshot below). ðŸš¦

Don't settle for "good enough." Regularly monitor your metrics and optimize load timesâ€”they can change how well your pages rank. 

I spent time understanding Next.js and optimizing all of my content to be static whenever possible, even when it meant rewriting much of my application. 

I serve lightweight images. 

Tech stack:
 * Nextjs & Tailwind 
 * Vercel
 * MDX

 MDX was a critical choice. It allows me to write rapidly in a format I'm familiar with, while also composing custom React components, such as Newsletter captures: 

 <NewsletterWrapper />

 into my blog posts ðŸ˜€. 

 This is what it looks like when I'm writing a post: 

 <Image src={markdown} alt="Markdown" />

## 2. I iterated relentlessly on user experience 

Engagement doesn't just come from good writingâ€”it comes from readable writing. Cleaner layouts, better typography, and simplified navigation made my content easier to consume and share.

Improving UX isn't a one-and-done task; it's an ongoing process. Over the past year, I experimented with:
* Typography tweaks to improve readability
* Streamlined layouts that focused on clarity over complexity
* Simplified navigation, ensuring readers could quickly find the content they needed

### Actionable Tip:

View your blog from your readers' perspective. Ask yourself:
* Is it easy to read?
* Can users find what they're looking for?
* Does your design serve the contentâ€”or distract from it?

## 3. I consistently published and shared

Consistency is the lifeblood of blogging. I wrote whenever inspiration struck, capturing ideas in notes and fleshing them out over time.

* Some posts took days to craft
* Othersâ€”like "Run Your Own Tech Blog"â€”took just 23 minutes because I'd been mulling over the topic for a year

Publishing was only half the battle. Sharing was just as important. I shared my posts on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Redditâ€”even when the feedback wasn't always kind (hello, trolls ðŸ‘‹).

### Actionable Tip:

Write regularly

## 4. I built tools, not just blog posts

Some of my most popular pages weren't articlesâ€”they were tools I built to solve real problems. Tools are a unique way to provide immediate value and drive sustained traffic.

If you have the skills to build, do it. It's one of the best ways to stand out.

### Actionable Tip:

Think about common challenges your audience faces. Can you build a tool, calculator, or resource to help solve them?

## 5. I let analytics guide me 

<Image src={googleClicks} alt="Google clicks" />

Google Search Console became my feedback loop. By analyzing search performance, I identified:
* **What resonated:** Doubling down on topics that performed well
* **What flopped:** Learning from content that didn't land

This iterative approach kept my blog relevant and valuable to my readers.

### Actionable Tip:

Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to refine your strategy. Pay attention to search queries, click-through rates, and audience behavior.

## Finding success blogging 

There's no magic formula to growing a successful blog. It's about iteration, experimentation, andâ€”above allâ€”consistency.
