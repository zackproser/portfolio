I've [written before](/blog/why-ive-been-successful) about how one of the best things I ever did for my career was to hire 
John Arundel as a Golang mentor.

In the time that I've known John, he started out as my Golang programming coach and then became more of a general software development and career mentor.  

Today, I feel fortunate to call him a friend. 

As we'd have our conversations back and forth on slack and zoom calls, I'd pick his brain about advancing in one's career, finding meaningful work and, as John elegantly puts it, crafting job that you don't need a vacation from.

The more we discussed this, the more John realized there was probably a book here, and that book is now available to the world and titled, ["My Horrible Career"](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/my-horrible-career).

I played a very small role in prompting him with some of the questions I was most curious to know the answers to. 

John is a very talented writer, an excellent teacher and mentor and he's generously made this book free, so be sure to head over and download it now!
