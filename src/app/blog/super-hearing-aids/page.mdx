## Tell me where to send my money 

I want to buy super hearing aids with the following requirements: 

### LLM onboard with vector storage and internet access

They need to be small enough to be comfortably worn, yet I expect unreasonably long battery life. They should be hard to notice yet unobstrusively enhance their wearer's senses and intelligence.

For example, an onboard LLM could auto translates any incoming language to my native tongue, help me remember important facts, dates, alert me that I'm going to be late...

They can be subtly signaled to start or stop listening and recording things and then eventually rules can be set based on context (never record inside my home).

### Pushes me real time alerts that relate to my safety or my family's safety

In essence, the super hearing aids are a blend of our best state of the art technologies that are easy to keep on me all day and which attempts to help keep me alive.

Can remind me how to retrace my steps and guide me back to where I parked my car

Could automatically call and route family and EMTs to my location if I fell ill or lost consciousness.

* Bluetooth or similar tech to connect to my television across the room, my game console when I'm playing
* Auto modulates volumes for my connected devices so I can easily talk to and hear the person I'm sitting with while connected to our game session on the TV
* If requested, auto transcribes for as long as needed to the cloud or my private data store
