There are two reasons I'm able to write quickly:

## Writing in my head

I mostly write new articles in my head while I'm walking around doing other things. 

This means that I am always turning over new ideas or the fragments or seeds that contain the whole post. 

Thereforey primary task here is really rapid capture: I'll either write a note in Obsidian under in progress writing or I'll create the post and pull request using Panthalia

## I instrument the process constantly

I built my own tool, Panthalia, which allows me to go from idea fragment to open pull request in seconds
