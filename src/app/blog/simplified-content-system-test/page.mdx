# Simplified Content System Test

This is a test article to demonstrate the simplified content system approach. With this approach, we can:

1. Define metadata directly in the MDX file
2. Use the same createMetadata function
3. Automatically route to the correct URL based on the file path
4. Handle paywalls and commerce features

## How It Works

The simplified content system leverages Next.js App Router's file-based routing to automatically handle content organization. Each content type has its own directory under `app/`, and each piece of content is a directory with a `page.mdx` file.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Simpler Organization**: Content is organized by type and slug in a predictable way
- **Less Code**: No need for complex path handling or content loading logic
- **Better Performance**: Next.js can optimize and statically generate these pages
- **Easier Maintenance**: Adding new content is as simple as creating a new directory and MDX file

## Premium Content Section

This section would only be visible to users who have purchased access to this content.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation relies on:

1. Next.js App Router's file-based routing
2. MDX for content authoring
3. TypeScript for type safety
4. The existing `createMetadata` function for metadata handling

## Conclusion

This simplified approach makes it much easier to manage content while maintaining all the existing functionality of the site.
