## Instructor Introduction

Hi, I'm Zachary, a Staff Developer Advocate at Pinecone.io, where we build the most performant cloud-native vector database 
that provides long-term memory for AI applications. 

<Image src={zacharyProser} alt="Zachary Proser" />

My full title at Pinecone is "Staff Developer Advocate (open-source)", meaning that I build AI applications and pipelines in public to help 
evangelize our vector database, as well as maintain our many open-source examples such as Jupyter Notebooks and TypeScript / Next.js applications, which demonstrate 
machine learning and AI techniques such as semantic search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

<Image src={a16z2} alt="Zachary Proser" />
<figcaption>Speaking at Andreesen Horowitz about taking Generative AI applications to production with the AWS Reference Architecture I created.</figcaption>

I also wrote [Pinecone's first production example](https://www.pinecone.io/blog/aws-reference-architecture/) in the [AWS Reference Architecture with Pulumi](https://github.com/pinecone-io/aws-reference-architecture-pulumi), which demonstrates how to perform 
semantic search at scale with Pinecone when you need to keep a traditional database like PostgreSQL in sync with your vector database.

## Introduction to Generative AI

<Callout title={"Generative AI is like a genie capable of fulfilling complex creative requests instantly"} type={"Metaphor"} body={"You can ask Generative AI to write code, translate English to Russian, make images in a variety of styles, rewrite your resume to target a new role, or help you think through complex scenarios."}/>

In this course, we'll examine exactly how and why Generative AI is able to do this, and what it means for creative types like software developers, artists, writers, designers and for creative industry in general.

<Callout title={"Explain the transformative impact of Generative AI"} type={"Focus"} body={"We'll begin our discussion by understanding what Generative AI is and why it is so powerful"}/>

Around January of 2023, Generative AI caused astonishment and existential dread for many creatives, allowing anyone with an internet connection to instantly conjure working code in any language, as well as images of any style, translations, and more,
simply by asking for them in natural human language. 

For example, you can ask a Generative AI tool: 

> Write me a JavaScript class representing a typical saas app user, and include methods for updating and deleting the user's profile. 

To which a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT would instantly respond: 

> To represent a typical SaaS app user in JavaScript, we can define a class named User with properties that might include an ID, name, email, and any other relevant information. For updating and deleting the user's profile, we can include methods within the class to handle these actions. Here's a sample implementation:

The Large Language Model would continue, writing the following code out to the user's screen in seconds:

```javascript

class User {
    constructor(id, name, email) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Update user profile in the database
    async updateProfile({ name, email }) {
        if (name) this.name = name;
        if (email) this.email = email;

        try {
            await sql`UPDATE users SET name = ${this.name}, email = ${this.email} WHERE id = ${this.id}`;
            console.log('User profile updated successfully.');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error updating user profile:', error);
            // Handle error (e.g., rollback transaction, log error, etc.)
        }
    }

    // Delete user profile from the database
    async deleteProfile() {
        try {
            await sql`DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ${this.id}`;
            console.log(`User with ID ${this.id} deleted successfully.`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error deleting user profile:', error);
            // Handle error
        }
    }

    // Method to display user info - useful for debugging
    displayUserInfo() {
        console.log(`User ID: ${this.id}, Name: ${this.name}, Email: ${this.email}`);
    }
}

// Example usage (inside an async function or top-level await in a module)
const user = new User(1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
user.displayUserInfo(); // Display initial user info

// Update user info
await user.updateProfile({ name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane.doe@example.com' });
user.displayUserInfo(); // Display updated user info

// Delete user
await user.deleteProfile();
```

Prior to the widespread availability of these tools, you more or less needed to understand Javascript, its most recent syntax changes, object oriented programming conventions and database abstractions, at a minimum, to produce this code. 

You also needed to have recently gotten some sleep, be more or less hydrated and have already had your caffeine - if you drink it - in order to create this simple example. And even the most highly-skilled keyboard-driven developers would have taken 
a bit longer than a few seconds to write this out. 

## Generative AI is not just text or code...

The same was true for images. Here's an example of me asking ChatGPT4 to generate me an image with the following prompt: 

> I'm creating a video game about horses enhanced with Jetpacks. Please generate me a beautiful, cheerful and friendly sprite of a horse with a jetpack strapped onto its back that would be suitable for use in my HTML5 game.  Use a bright, cheery and professional retro pixel-art style. 

<Image src={genAiExampleImageGeneration} alt="Generative AI can generate images as well as text" width={800} />
<figcaption>I can use Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate pixel art and other assets for my web and gaming projects.</figcaption>

Within a few moments, I got back a workable image that was more or less on the money given my prompt. 

I didn't have to open my image editor, spend hours tweaking pixels using specialized tools, or hit up my designer or digital artist friends for assistance.

### Why is this such a big deal?

Prior to the proliferation of LLMs and Generative AI models, you needed to have some pixel art skills, and be proficient in use of photo editing / creation software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or GIMP in order to produce this image. 

You would also need a considerable amount of skill and time, and the same caveats apply about hydration and caffeine.

<Callout title={"Generative AI democratizes capabilities that previously belonged only to specialized practictioners"} type={"PracticalInsights"} body={"Before the advent of Generative AI, you needed to be a specialist to produce specialized outputs. But Generative AI is turning this requirement on its head."}/>

You needed to be a software developer to produce working code. 

You needed to be a visual artist to produce images, or a digital artist to produce pixel art, video game assets, logos, etc.

With Generative AI on the scene, this is no longer strictly true. 

**There are some major caveats to understand around this piece** such as why Generative AI is currently a huge boon to senior and above level developers, but commonly misleading and actively harmful to junior developers, but in general it holds true.

<Callout title={"How my developer friends and I started using Gen AI"} type={"PracticalInsights"} body={"Since the initial release of ChatGPT, my colleagues and I began experimenting with the tool as a means to enhance and streamline our many day to day development tasks. Here's what stood out as winning use cases for us:"}/>

* Asking the LLM to write scripts to perform one-off tasks (migrating data, cleaning up projects, taking backups of databases, etc)
* Asking the LLM to explain a giant and complex stack trace (error) that came from a piece of code we're working with
* Asking the LLM to take some unstructured input (raw files, log streams, security audits, etc), extract insights and return a simple list of key-value pairs

### v0.dev

Vercel's v0.dev tool which generates user interfaces in React in response to natural language queries.

In the above example, I prompted the app with: 

> A beautiful pricing page with three large columns showing my free, pro and enterprise tiers of service for my new saas news offering 

and the app immediately produced three separate versions that I can continue to iterate on in natural language, asking for visual refinements to the layout, style, colors, font-size and more.

Prior to Gen AI, all of this work would have been done by hand by a technical designer sitting closely with at least one frontend developer.

### Pulumi AI

Pulumi AI generates working Pulumi programs that describe infrastructure as code in response to natural language prompts

## Generative AI accelerates professionals and specialists

<Callout title={"Before and after the Generative AI boom"} type={"PracticalInsights"} body={"It's helpful to consider what major tasks looked like before and after Gen AI"}/>

Generative AI is powerful because it enables development use cases that were previously out of reach due to being too technically complex for one developer to build out on their own.

I've experienced this phenomenon myself. I have been pair-coding alongside Generative AI models for {timeElapsedSinceJanuary2023()}, and in that time **I have started work on more ambitious applications** than I normally would have tackled as side proejcts. 

**I have gotten unstuck faster** when faced with a complex or confusing failure scenario, because I was able to talk through the problem with ChatGPT and discuss alternative approaches. ChatGPT4 responds to me 
with the quality of response and breadth of experience that I previously only would have expected from senior and staff level engineers.

**I have enjoyed my work more**, because now I have a supremely helpful colleague who is always available, in my time zone. Gen AI is never busy, never frustrated or overwhelmed, and is more likely to have read widely and deeply on a given 
technology subject than a human engineer.

### Emotional support and mind defragging with Pi.ai

[Pi.ai](https://pi.ai/) is the most advanced model I've encountered when it comes to relating to human beings. I have had success using Pi to have a quick chat and talk through something that is 
frustrating or upsetting me at work, and in between 15 and 25 minutes of conversation, I've processed and worked through the issue and my feelings and am clear headed enough to make forward progress again. 

This is a powerful remover of obstacles, because the longer I do what I do, the more clear it becomes that EQ is more critical than IQ. Noticing when I'm irritated or overwhelmed and having a quick talk with someone 
highly intelligent and sensitive in order to process things and return with a clear mind is invaluable.

Pi's empathy is off the charts, and it feels like you're speaking with a highly skilled relational therapist.

## Where I see this going 
It's really hard to write production-ready code that handles the business requirements correctly and that also is workable by other humans

## What I would pay for in the future
Intelligent dev assistant 
Aware of my contexts: GitHub repos, websites I use, internal tools, personal notes, engineering log books

## Opportunities

Generative AI is projected to see an annual growth rate of 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to Forbes.

## Challenges

### Hallucinations can lead junior developers astray

### Tool fragmentation and explosion

### Navigating a rapidly evolving landscape

## My Thoughts: As a developer

I've been hacking alongside generative AI {timeElapsedSinceJanuary2023()}

I enjoy it because I have a helpful and always available second brain. I've been able to ship more ambitious apps more quickly and I've had more fun doing it than ever before.
