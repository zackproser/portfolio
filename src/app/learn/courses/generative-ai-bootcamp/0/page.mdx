## Instructor Introduction

Hi, I'm Zachary, a Staff Developer Advocate at Pinecone.io, where we build the most performant cloud-native vector database 
that provides long-term memory for AI applications.

My full title at Pinecone is "Staff Developer Advocate (open-source)", meaning that I build AI applications and pipelines in public to help 
evangelize our vector database, as well as maintain our many open-source examples such as Jupyter Notebooks and TypeScript / Next.js applications. 

I also wrote Pinecone's first production example in the AWS Reference Architecture with Pulumi, which demonstrates how to perform 
semantic search at scale with Pinecone when you need to keep a traditional database like PostgreSQL in sync with your vector database.


## Opportunities

Generative AI is projected to see an annual growth rate of 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to Forbes.
