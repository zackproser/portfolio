## Let's Practice!

Here's an interactive example where you can modify the CSS and see the changes in real-time:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/zackproser/r4w76any/1/embedded/html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

Try experimenting with different CSS properties and values to see how they affect the appearance of the elements. You can also target specific elements using classes or IDs to apply different styles to them.

## Conclusion

CSS is a powerful tool that allows you to transform your plain HTML structure into an attractive and visually engaging website. By mastering CSS, you'll be able to create beautiful designs, customize layouts, and enhance the user experience of your static portfolio website.
