## Preparing Your Development Environment

Before we start coding our portfolio website, it's essential to have a well-prepared development environment. In this section, we'll guide you through the tools you'll need and provide step-by-step instructions on how to set them up on your computer.
Essential Tools

To develop your static website, you'll need the following tools:

* Text Editor: A text editor is where you'll write your HTML, CSS, and other code files. We recommend using Visual Studio Code, a free and powerful code editor with many useful features for web development.
* Web Browser: You'll use a web browser to view and test your website locally. Modern browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge are recommended for their robust developer tools.
* Git: Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and manage your project effectively. It's an essential tool for any developer.

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and customizable code editor that's perfect for web development. Here's how to install it on your operating system:

### Windows
1. Visit the Visual Studio Code website and click on the "Download" button.
1. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard's prompts.
1. After the installation is complete, launch Visual Studio Code from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

### MacOSX
1. Visit the Visual Studio Code website and click on the "Download" button.
1. Once the ZIP file is downloaded, double-click on it to extract the application.
1. Drag the Visual Studio Code application to your Applications folder.
1. Launch Visual Studio Code from the Applications folder or using Spotlight search.

### Linux
1. Visit the Visual Studio Code website and click on the ".deb" or ".rpm" download link, depending on your Linux distribution.
1. Once the package is downloaded, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file.
1. Run the following command to install Visual Studio Code:
1. For .deb packages: sudo dpkg -i code_*.deb
1. For .rpm packages: sudo rpm -i code_*.rpm
1. After the installation is complete, launch Visual Studio Code from your application launcher or by typing code in the terminal.

## Creating a Project Folder

Before we start coding, let's create a folder to store our project files:

1. Open your file explorer and navigate to a location where you want to create your project folder.
1. Create a new folder and name it something like my-portfolio.
1. Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" -> "Open Folder" (or "Open" on macOS).
1. Select the my-portfolio folder you just created and click "Open".

## Introduction to Git

Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes to your code and collaborate with others. Here's how to set it up:

1. Visit the Git website and download the installer for your operating system.
1. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard's prompts. You can leave the default settings as they are.
1. Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Configure your Git username and email address by running the following commands:

```
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
Replace Your Name with your desired username and youremail@example.com with your email address.

## Setting Up GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features. Here's how to create an account:

1. Visit the GitHub website and click on the "Sign up" button.
1. Fill in the required information (username, email, and password) and click on "Create account".
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the account setup process.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now set up your development environment with Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. You're ready to start building your static portfolio website.
