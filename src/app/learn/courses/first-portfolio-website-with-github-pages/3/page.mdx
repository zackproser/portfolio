## Using Git for Version Control

Welcome to the second section of our course. Here, you will learn about Git, a crucial tool for any developer, which allows you to track changes in your files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you keep track of your code changes and collaborate with others. It allows you to revert back to previous versions of your work and manage different versions of your projects efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of version control.
- Learn to initialize a Git repository.
- Know how to commit changes and push them to a remote repository (like GitHub).

## Setting Up Git

First, ensure that Git is installed on your computer. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). After installation, set up your user name and email in your terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
