Welcome to the first section of our course, where we'll dive into the basics of web development. This module will set the foundation for your journey in building your first static website.

## What is a Static Website?

Static websites are basic web pages that deliver content without the need for server-side processing. Unlike dynamic websites, static pages are straightforward to create and host, making them an ideal starting point for beginners.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between static and dynamic websites.
- Learn the basic structure of HTML documents.
- Get started with CSS to style your web pages.

## HTML Basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. It allows you to structure your web content with elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of your professional web presence.</p>
</body>
</html>
