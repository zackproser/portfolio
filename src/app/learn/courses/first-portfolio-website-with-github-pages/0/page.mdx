## Static vs. Dynamic Websites

Before we dive into HTML, let's clarify the difference between static and dynamic websites:

* Static Websites: These are basic web pages that deliver content without the need for server-side processing. The content remains the same for every user and is easy to create and host, making them ideal for beginners.
* Dynamic Websites: These websites generate content on the fly, often pulling information from databases or external sources. They require server-side processing and are more complex to develop and maintain.

For this course, we'll focus on building a static portfolio website.
