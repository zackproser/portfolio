## Introduction to Git

Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes to your code and collaborate with others. Here's how to set it up:

1. Visit the Git website and download the installer for your operating system.
1. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard's prompts. You can leave the default settings as they are.
1. Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Configure your Git username and email address by running the following commands:

```
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
Replace Your Name with your desired username and youremail@example.com with your email address.
