## Install Ruby and Bundler

Jekyll is built on Ruby, so you'll need to have Ruby installed on your system along with Bundler, which manages Ruby gems.

## Install Ruby:
* **Windows**: Download and install Ruby using RubyInstaller. During installation, check the box to add Ruby to your PATH.
* **macOS/Linux**: Ruby usually comes pre-installed on these platforms. You can check by typing ruby -v in your terminal. If itâ€™s not installed or you need an upgrade, use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS (brew install ruby) or apt-get for Ubuntu (sudo apt-get install ruby-full).

Install Bundler:
After installing Ruby, install Bundler by running:

```bash
gem install bundler
```
