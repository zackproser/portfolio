## Creating your first repository 

Navigate to the directory of your project and run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This command creates a new .git folder in your project, tracking all changes made to files in this directory.
Committing Your First Change

Add a file to the repository, like an index.html, then track it with Git using the following commands:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add initial HTML file"
```
