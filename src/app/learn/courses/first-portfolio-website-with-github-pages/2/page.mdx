## HTML: The structure of your website 

HTML is the backbone of any website. It allows you to structure your web content using various elements, such as:

* Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create titles and subtitles.
* Paragraphs (`<p>`) to organize text content.
* Links (`<a>`) to connect web pages or external resources.
* Images (`<img>`) to display visual content.

Here's a basic example of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Your First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>This is the beginning of your professional web presence.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the key components:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5.
* `<html>`: The root element that contains the entire HTML document.
* `<head>`: Provides metadata and links to external resources (CSS, JavaScript).
* `<title>`: Specifies the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar.
* `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

## Structuring Your Portfolio

Using HTML, you can create a basic structure for your portfolio website. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Your Name</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Write a brief introduction about yourself.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="projects">
      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Project 1</li>
        <li>Project 2</li>
        <li>Project 3</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="contact">
      <h2>Contact Me</h2>
      <p>Include your contact information or a contact form.</p>
    </section>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 Your Name. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we've used semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create a meaningful structure for your portfolio website.

## Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of every website, allowing you to structure and organize your content. By understanding the basics of HTML, you're now ready to start building your static portfolio website.

In the next section, we'll explore CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which will allow you to add style and visual appeal to your HTML structure, bringing your website to life.
