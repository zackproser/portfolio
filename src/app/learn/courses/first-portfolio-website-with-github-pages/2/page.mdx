## CSS: Painting Your Website

If HTML is the foundation and structure of your house, CSS is the paint, decor, and design that makes it visually appealing. 

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to control the presentation of your HTML elements, bringing your website to life with colors, fonts, layouts, and more.

## How CSS Works

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. You can select elements by their tag names, classes, IDs, or other attributes. Here's a simple example that changes the color and alignment of a heading and paragraph:

```css

h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: gray;
  text-align: center;
}
```

In this example, we've selected all `(<h1>)` elements and applied a blue color and center alignment. Similarly, we've selected all paragraph `(<p>)` elements and applied a gray color and center alignment.

## Connecting CSS to Your HTML

To use CSS with your HTML, you can either:

* Write CSS directly in your HTML file using the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
* Create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

For better organization and maintainability, it's recommended to use a separate CSS file, especially as your website grows.

## Exploring CSS Properties

CSS offers a wide range of properties to style your elements. Some common properties include:

* color: Sets the text color.
* background-color: Sets the background color of an element.
* font-family: Specifies the font for text.
* font-size: Sets the size of the text.
* padding: Adds space inside an element's borders.
* margin: Adds space outside an element's borders.
* border: Sets a border around an element.

## Let's Practice!

Here's an interactive example where you can modify the CSS and see the changes in real-time:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/zackproser/r4w76any/1/embedded/html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

Try experimenting with different CSS properties and values to see how they affect the appearance of the elements. You can also target specific elements using classes or IDs to apply different styles to them.

## Conclusion

CSS is a powerful tool that allows you to transform your plain HTML structure into an attractive and visually engaging website. By mastering CSS, you'll be able to create beautiful designs, customize layouts, and enhance the user experience of your static portfolio website.
