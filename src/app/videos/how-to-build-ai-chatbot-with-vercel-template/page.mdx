Curious how you might take Vercel's ai-chatbot template repository from GitHub and turn it into your own GPT-like chatbot of any identity? That's what I walkthrough in this video. 

I show the git diffs and commit history while talking through how I integrated langchain, OpenAI, ElevenLabs for voice cloning and text to speech and Pinecone.io for the vector database in order to create a fully featured chat-GPT-like custom AI bot that can answer, factually, for an arbitrary corpus of knowledge.
