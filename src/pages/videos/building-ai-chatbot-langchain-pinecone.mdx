What's involved in building an AI chatbot that is trained on a custom corpus of knowledge? In this video I breakdown the data preparation, training and app development components and explain why Jupyter notebooks were such a handy tool while creating this app and tweaking my model.

App is open source at https://github.com/zackproser/office-... and a demo is currently available at https://office-oracle.vercel.app.
