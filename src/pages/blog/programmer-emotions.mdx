|  When  |   I feel |   
|---|---|
|  My program compiles after an onerous redactoring|  elation|   
|  People add meetings to my calendar to talk through things they need help sorting out| wasted and misunderstood   |   
| Another developer says something I created was helpful to them| Like a link in a long chain stretching from the past into the future|  
| Someone downloads my code, tool or package| absolutely victorious |
| I ship something important | A mixture of satisfaction, hope and dread that I've missed something important|
