export const meta = {
  author: "Zachary Proser",

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />
  
 Content - this is a bunch of content that should appear in the blog post in paragraph form. 

That means the newlines should definitely be preserved. 

Is this markdown? 

## Can I add a larger title?

How about some code snippets?

```javascript
let it = "please work ;)"
```
