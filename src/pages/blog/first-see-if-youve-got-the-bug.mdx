## First, see if you've got the programming bug 

If you are someone who is: 

* Currently studying computer science in school
* Thinking about learning to code
* Thinking about your major or career or general life trajectory 

then this article is for you. 

A lot of different folks ask me if they should learn to code, if software development is a good career trajectory for them or their children, and what they need to study in school in order
to be successful. 

I decided to consolidate my advice into a single article to make it easier to share in the future. 

Here's my advice: 

Before you should worry about any of that, your major, which school you're trying to get your kid into, which laptop you should purchase, you need to figure out if you have the "programming bug". 

## The spark of curiosity is what you're looking for 

In my personal experience, speaking about my own career, and also considering the folks I've worked with professionally who have similar backgrounds, the single determining criteria for success is 
innate curiosity and interest in the field, in the tools, in the possibilities, in what you can build, share, learn and teach about. 

Do you find yourself thinking about that last coding problem after you walk away from the computer? Are you catching yourself dreaming of other applications or games you could build? 

## It might not happen overnight 

I've been close to and using computers since I was 3, but I never considered myself a developer until I started teaching myself in earnest at around age 26. Along the way, I once had a neighborhood friend 
who was playing one of the early Descent games on his PC in his room, around when we were 11 years old or so. 

He also had a C++ textbook that he let me borrow and read through. At the tender age of 11, I was thinking to myself that I would read this book, become a developer, and then make my own games. I started by 
trying to understand the textbook material. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this didn't pan out - and it would be another 15 years until I'd make a conscious decision to learn to code. 

My point is that the timeline can be lumpy and will look different for different people. That's okay. 

## Don't make these mistakes

When I get asked these questions, a lot of the same eagerness to purchase expensive courses or equipment or sign up for lifestyle altering education or bootcamps. 

I encourage folks at this point to pump the breaks, because there is a much cheaper (read, free) means of discovering if you might have an interest and aptitude for software development and related fields: use the 
many excellent and free resources online (on a free library computer if need be) to get hands on coding with simple exercises first. 

Here's what I believe would be overkill and unnecessary at this stage: 

* Committing upfront with your money and your time to a lengthy degree program because Dad thinks computer science is a good career for you 
* Buying an expensive mac book because you want to see if you may want to become a developer one day 
*
