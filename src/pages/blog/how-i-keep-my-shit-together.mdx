I've been working mostly in intense tech startups for the past 11.5 years. This is the arrangement I've come to settle on that helps me stay healthy and somewhat sane.

In the timeline below, I lay out what an ideal workday looks like for me. Notice there's a good split between things for my body and mind and my own creative pursuits and things my employer needs. After 5 or 6PM, it's family time. 

Beneath the timeline, I go more in depth into each phase and why it is currently working for me.

## Wake up early  

I tend to be an early riser by nature, but with age and additional responsibilities it's no longer a given that I'll spring out of bed at 5AM the way I used to. I set a smart wake alarm on my fitbit which attempts to rouse me when I'm 
already in light sleep as close to my target alarm time as possible. 

I've found that the more time I give myself in the morning for what is important to me, the less resentful I am likely to become even if the workday ends up being intense and stressful. 

This is something of a nod to the burnout is about resentment 
idea, but what I've done now for the past two jobs with this time is essentially some combination of read, sit in the sun, meditate, drink my coffee, and hack on stuff that I care about like my [many side projects](https://github.com/zackproser).

## Get sunlight 

This helps me feel alert and gets my circadian cycle on track for the day. 

## Vipassana meditation

I sit with my eyes closed and see what I can notice and label very gently: inhaling, exhaling, thinking, hearing, feeling, hunger, pain, fear, thinking, etc.

## Metta meditation

This is a relatively newer addition to my routine. I explicitly take time out of my day to generate feelings of loving kindness for myself, and attempt to visualize myself feeling safe, healthy, happy and living with ease. This one I may do alongside a YouTube video. [Manoj Dias of Open has a great one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj0JDwQLof4).
