## Are we getting closer to authoring complete blog posts?

This is a story about an archer who was under-leveled getting FUCKED UP by a monster in a dungeon.

<Image src={one} alt="See" />

It has a beginning, a middle, and an ending, and all these images were generated asynchronously at post creation time. 

<Image src={two} alt="See 2" />

This is the end where the archer leaves. 

<Image src={three} alt="See 3" />
