# OpenGraph Image Generation System

## How the OG Image System Works (2024+)

- **Every content item (blog, video, product, etc.) can have a unique OG image.**
- **OG images are generated by running a script manually:**
  - Run `npm run og:generate` (or `node scripts/og-image-generator.js`) after adding or updating content.
  - The script extracts metadata, generates OG images (using hero image if present, fallback if not), and uploads them to blob storage.
- **If you forget to run the script:**
  - The site will serve a fallback OG image for new/updated content, using the correct title/description but a default background.
  - No broken links or errorsâ€”just less visually unique OG images until you run the script.
- **You can automate this later (CI, post-publish, cron), but manual is fine.**

## Quickstart

1. Add or update content (MDX, etc.)
2. Run:
   ```sh
   node scripts/og-image-generator.js --verbose
   # or
   npm run og:generate
   ```
3. OG images are generated and uploaded to blob storage.
4. Deploy as usual.

## Troubleshooting
- If OG images are missing for new content, just rerun the script.
- If a hero image is missing, the fallback will be used.
- No need to check in any cache files; everything is generated on demand.
