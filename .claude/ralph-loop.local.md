What can you do to improve the situation with /devtools and /vectordatabases? Both of these are supposed to be lead generation tools where they help me rank highly for those terms for both the dev tools themselves and for vector databases. They then generate via that way additional opportunities to talk to investors or advise other companies.

The problem is that they're not really maintainable right now. They're not really telling the truth; they're not really pointing to metrics that would be ideal to scale a solution like this built into my Next.js site. It's not easy for me to add new ones, it's not easy for me to update stuff, and this feels like a missed opportunity. We might be leaving traffic on the table.

Look at them and see what you can do to significantly improve both tools so that they're easier for me to maintain, giving better pedagogical value and information to people, and also look better and fit with our new updated site theme in light mode which I like better.
